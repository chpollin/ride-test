          <p>Catullus Online, a collection of the author’s poems and a repository of
               the conjectures collected through the centuries, was published by Dániel Kiss with
               the support of the Abteilung für Griechische und Lateinische Philologie
               of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, in 2013. Kiss faced many difficulties
               in the creation of such a resource, both from a technical standpoint and from the
               inner complexity of the philological tradition behind Catullus and his poems. He
               still ended up creating a rather interesting Scholarly Digital Edition, which has
               made such work more accessible, even to those that don’t typically belong in the
               academic world, offering the possibility to access high-quality photos of the
               manuscripts, a curated apparatus and much other information about the texts and the
               author, with just a simple click. What is mostly missing in this project is a more
               sophisticated digital interface, a lost opportunity to further enhance the quality of
               such a Scholarly Digital Edition.</p>

<p><em>Catullus Online</em> was developed thanks to the research project <em>An
                  Online Repertory of Conjectures for Catullus</em> (2009–2013), promoted by the
               Center for Advanced Studies and the <em>Abteilung für Griechische und Lateinische
                  Philologie</em> of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, which financed
               the project. The result of the project is now reachable as a digital resource through
               the URL “http://www.catullusonline.org”.</p>
<p>Dániel Kiss is the editor and creator of <em>Catullus Online</em>,
               and he was helped by a group composed of philologists like Giuseppe Gilberto Biondi
               and Michael Reeve and experts in Classics like David Butterfield, Carlotta
               Dionisotti, Julia Gaisser, Daniel Hadas, Stephen Harrison, Jeffrey Henderson,
               Giovanni Maggiali, and John Trappes-Lomax who worked with him on tracing conjectures
               – critical reconstructions of corrupted passages of text – and rare books. After
               having been published in 2013, the work on <em>Catullus Online</em> was further
               developed during the research project <em>The textual transmission of
                  Catullus</em> (2015–2017), which was realized at the Universitat de
               Barcelona.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">General parameters and introduction</h3>
<p>The idea behind this project first appeared to Kiss during his stay at
               Scuola Normale di Pisa in 2005, where he was confronted with the controversial
               textual history of Catullus’ poems and their manuscripts (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 101). To better understand this complex
               history, Kiss went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2007, where
               he was able to study the Halle-Ullman Papers as well as the collation and the
               transcription of 113 manuscripts of Catullus made by William Gardner Hale, Euan T.
               Sage, Berthold L. Ullman, and other scholars of the 20th century.<span class="note">[From the Section ABOUT THE WEBSITE in Catullus Online: http://web.archive.org/web/20231215114144/http://www.catullusonline.org/CatullusOnline/index.php?dir=edited_pages&pageID=5.]</span>
               By this time, he chose not to create a new edition of Catullus’ poems, and instead,
               he focused on “mapping the manuscript tradition and drawing up conjectures”(<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 101).</p>
<p><em>Catullus Online</em> was first created as a repository of conjectures and
               later – with the development and employment of further elements – as a digital
               critical edition. The choice of an online publication was due to the various problems
               that came with printed editions since many were expensive and not accessible across
               the world, whereas a digital publication instead allowed Kiss to make his project
               more accessible and to display some additional elements (e.g., search tools, the
               possibility to visualize the images of the manuscript and to consult more easily the
               apparatus) that could not be used in a printed edition (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 102-103).</p>
<p>It is easy to understand the general parameters of <em>Catullus
                  Online</em> since the titles of its various sections are very explicit, and Kiss
               has done a good job of explaining his work and his editorial principles through the
               two sections in the menu on the left in the lower side of the site: “ABOUT THE
               WEBSITE”, where he explains the journey to the creation of the project and then of
               the website, and “ABOUT THE REPOSITORY”, which instead illustrates his philological
               attitude towards the manuscripts and conjectures. In these two sections, there are
               many links to external web resources, which are clickable and offer the possibility
               to explore further the sources used for <em>Catullus Online</em>, although a few
               have not been updated and will lead to old or inactive pages. To know more about the
               methods used in this project, users can read <em>Catullus Online: A Digital
                  Critical Edition of the Poems of Catullus with a Repertory of Conjectures</em>,
               an essay written by Dániel Kiss, where he further explains his working process and
               his editorial choices.</p>
</section>

<section id="div3">
  <h3 class="h5">Subject and content of the edition</h3>
<p><em>Catullus Online</em> is composed of the full text of all 116 poems written by
               Catullus, accompanied by a critical, diachronic, and positive apparatus – meaning
               that both accepted and rejected readings are present (<a href="#mace_roelli2015" target="_blank">Macé and Roelli 2015</a>) – containing the textual
               notes and all the conjectures which have been made on the text so far and which Kiss
               has collected through his work.</p>
<p>The text of the poems is based on the manuscripts which stem from the
                  <em>Codex Veronensis</em> (V), the oldest witness of Catullus’ manuscripts,
               and is directly accessible through “POEMS”, whereas to use the apparatus, the user
               will have to go to the section “POEMS WITH APPARATUS”. The biggest achievement of
               such a format is that it creates a free curated digital edition of Catullus, allowing
               the user both to have complete access to all the conjectures found by Kiss and to
               interact with different texts and even unpublished papers (e.g., Berthold L. Ulman’s
               ones). The editor focused on the investigation of his sources, many of which had not
               been verified by previous scholars. To do so, he proceeded to personally transcribe
               half a dozen undocumented manuscripts he found at Chapel Hill and two incunables that
               were not available in any libraries of Munich and neither online. This resulted in
               Kiss owning a collation, a reproduction, or a transcription of all known manuscripts
               of Catullus that were copied before 1520 and of all printed editions from the editio
               princeps of 1472 up to the first Aldine of 1502 (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 104-105). Other than <em>Catullus
                  Online</em>, there are many classical Latin texts already available online, but
               unlike this case, they are just digital reproductions of the printed edition, in some
               cases scanned with OCR, with no optional functionalities or a full apparatus (<a href="#nappa2017" target="_blank">Nappa 2017</a>).</p>
<p>Another achievement of <em>Catullus Online</em> is the fact that
               users can directly visualize the images of the manuscripts, and the possibility to
               access these helps to shed light on the complex textual schema behind Catullus’
               tradition, allowing academics – and other interested users – to consult the
               manuscripts behind the text of the project. More precisely, we can see images of only
               O, G, and T since <em>Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana</em> – which is currently
               holding the manuscript R – does not allow the online publication of high-resolution
               images of its manuscripts outside of its website (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 107). The possibility to directly see the
               images of the manuscripts employed for a critical edition is not frequent, mostly due
               to traditional copyright restrictions. In fact, many libraries do not allow
               high-quality reproductions of the manuscripts they store, and they are neither
               trained nor funded to handle the incoming need for digitization other than
               conservation. To solve this problem, new application format interfaces – e.g., IIIF,
               the International Image Interoperability Framework – are being implemented to offer
               the possibility to let the libraries – e.g., the <em>Bodleian Library</em> –
               continue hosting their images on their home servers while allowing other sites to
               display them, offering the possibility to easily share various cultural artifacts on
               the web (<a href="#mastronarde2020" target="_blank">Mastronarde 2020</a>,
               116).</p>

                  Screenshot of the description of manuscript 90.
               The users can also access the section “TESTIMONIA”, where quotations of
               Catullus found in ancient and medieval texts are stored as indirect witnesses of his
               textual tradition, whereas through the section “BIBLIOGRAPHY”, the user will be able
               to find the bibliography that was used to create this project. “MANUSCRIPTS” gives us
               the full list of the manuscripts, and they are divided into two groups:
                  T, O, G, R, m, S.These manuscripts are introduced with a small
                     description of their main details, such as where and when they were copied, the
                     writing used, their measures, and other important specifics, as can be seen in
                        Figure 1.
                  Other surviving manuscripts of Catullus’ Liber. They are
                     each identified by a number and ordered alphabetically. This system is based on
                     the list of manuscripts created by D. F. S. Thompson (1997, 77-92) and further elaborated and curated
                     by Kiss in 2012. They have their main details – such as where they are now
                     stored, and where and when they were copied – next to their identifying number,
                     as can be seen in Figure 2.</p>
<p>In “ABOUT THE WEBSITE” and “ABOUT THE REPOSITORY”, all the information
               about the methods and tools that have been used to build the repository and the
               website is given, and in “HELP” and “CONTACT”, you can find all the useful
               information to navigate the website and to properly contact the editor for feedback
               or further inquiries. While the general interface, the navigation bar, and the
               sections are given in English, the poems are available only in Latin, with no
               translation into any other language offered. To offer a translation at least into
               English would be very helpful since this edition is meant to reach not only scholars
               but anybody with Internet access (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss
                  2020</a>, 103) and it might also involve people who do not have a solid base in
               Latin in the <em>Catullus Online</em> project. A few other features that could be
               implemented are sections or pages about Catullus’ life and his context, as well as to
               encourage other kinds of studies on the poems, such as historical or linguistic
               ones.</p>
</section>

<section id="div4">
  <h3 class="h5">Aims and methods</h3>
<p><em>Catullus Online</em> was originally born as a repository of conjectures, but
               later, the editor chose to transform it into a digital critical edition by adding the
               text of the poems to the repository. The digital aspect of this edition was meant to
               allow for searchability through an interconnected text, a user-friendly and
               easy-to-use interface supported by all browsers, and reminiscent of the standards
               upheld by printed editions (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>,
               103). The constitution of the text is made in a rather traditional way, with an
               apparatus and a repertory of conjectures (<a href="#nappa2017" target="_blank">Nappa 2017</a>), to avoid distracting the viewer from the focal points and
               complicating the consultation of the website.</p>
<p>The two missions of this digital critical edition are to offer a
               reliable text and to give students a research tool for the future (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 113-114). An audience that
               could benefit from this edition is also undergraduates or secondary school students,
               as the easy-to-use interface would allow them to study the poems and the apparatus
               easily to deepen their knowledge (<a href="#nappa2017" target="_blank">Nappa
                  2017</a>). The main manuscripts are known as TOGR, and since they are all
               independent of each other, they all have source value (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 103):

                     stored in Oxford, Bodleian Library (O).
                  
                     Sangermanensis, copied in Verona in 1375, is currently stored in
                     Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France (G).
                  
                     Romanus, copied in Florence 1375–1395, currently stored in Rome,

                     Thuaneus, an anthology of Latin poetry copied around 850 in
                     central France stored in Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France;
                     unlike the others, it does not derive directly from the Codex
                        Veronensis (T) (Kiss
                        2020, 101-103).</p>
<p>Screenshot of the apparatus of verse 1 (carmen 1).
               Another important element of a critical edition is the apparatus where all
               the conjectures are stored alongside the critical and textual notes. In this case, we
               can talk about a proper critical apparatus because the variant readings of the
               various witnesses are stored alongside the conjectures. The apparatus appears on the
               right of the poem either through clicking the option “SHOW FULL APPARATUS” or the
               triangle icon in the section “POEMS WITH APPARATUS” next to the first line of the
               poem. This way, you can easily visualize all the diachronic dimensions of the text
               with one click, as shown in <a href="#img3" target="_blank">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<p>The manuscripts are either recognized through their sigla or with their
               number in the list, while the apparatus itself is ordered chronologically,
               registering all the first instances of the conjectures stored inside of it. However,
               there are a few exceptions and limitations due to the still unknown relationships
               between many Renaissance manuscripts and humanistic conjectures. Not having a fully
               developed stemma of all of Catullus’ manuscripts and having many families of codices
               that cannot be linked to any of the parent nodes (TOGR) has made the task of fully
               understanding the relationships between manuscripts and their dates rather difficult
               and complex (<a href="#bertone2017" target="_blank">Bertone 2017</a>, 1). Kiss
               distanced himself from Mynors’ theories – refusing the theory of the eight layers of
               humanistic conjectures<span class="note">[R.A.B Mynors, to make sense of the
                  complexity of Catullus’ tradition, recognized eight layers of humanistic
                  corrections and named them after the Greek letters αβγδεζηθ to distinguish them
                     (Kiss 2013, 2017). According
                  to Dániel Kiss, this system proved to be highly problematic due to its
                  inconsistency.]</span> – and edition, in the aspects of presentation and editing,
               for example, by choosing not to reproduce here the fragmentary <em>Priapea</em>,
               placed by Muretus between the poems 17 and 21 (<a href="#nappa2017" target="_blank">Nappa 2017</a>).</p>
<p><em>Catullus Online</em> does not follow the TEI Guidelines since, back in 2009,
               when the project was planned by the editor, he was not aware of the possibility of
               using models that were different from the digitized book and the text-only online
               publication. By then, the TEI consortium had already developed digital guidelines for
               digital critical editions like <em>Catullus Online</em>. However, these
               guidelines would not have been compatible with the project since the apparatus had to
               be marked up manually or semi-automatically. This would have been too time-consuming
               for the project at hand, although the guidelines might have been useful as a starting
               point since they offer a rather durable and robust system of tags (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 103-104).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the website employed a standard for the texts: HTML, a
               formal recommendation by the W3C, used to showcase documents in a browser. Such a
               standard is solid and quite easy to use, making the project further interoperable and
               structured through an understandable setup. It can also be adapted for different
               formats (such as mobile or desktop) and can be used in all major browsers, as was
               Kiss’ original objective in creating his digital edition.</p>
<p>Another aspect to take into consideration, aside from the employment of
               only a very basic but solid standard for the encoding of texts, is the fact that Kiss
               has not allowed <em>Catullus Online</em> to be citable through CTS
                  (<em>Canonical Text Services</em>), losing a chance to allow the website to be
               accessible and employ the tools available through such a service (<a href="#blackwell_smith2014" target="_blank">Blackwell and Smith 2014</a>).
               This also limits the potentiality of such a project in the world of linked open data,
               which has by now become a norm in the digital humanities environment.</p>
<p>All the information about the aims and methods of <em>Catullus
                  Online</em> can be found in the “ABOUT THE REPOSITORY” section on the website
               and in the essay <em>Catullus Online: A Digital Critical Edition of the Poems of
                  Catullus with a Repertory of Conjectures</em> (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 99-114), where all methods, theories, and
               ideas are documented to fully explain the process behind the choices made on the text
               constitution.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Publication and presentation</h3>
<p>Kiss worked with Woodpecker Software to construct the website on which
                  <em>Catullus Online</em> is presented, and with Stalker Studio for its design.
               To realize <em>Catullus Online</em>, the engineers of Woodpecker Software
               employed the programming language PHP and the open-source database management system
               MySQL, which has been employed mostly in the apparatus part (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 105-109).</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the TEI Guidelines are not employed, and neither a
               model like the one used by the digital project <em>Musisque Deoque</em> (<a href="#biondi_etal2005" target="_blank">Biondi et al. 2005</a>) – a platform
               where many digital critical editions of Latin literature are stored – is used. The
               poems and the apparatus would need to be manually or semi-automatically encoded,
               which would be a rather slow process for the huge number of conjectures stored in
                  <em>Catullus Online</em>. Instead, Kiss’ project seems to remain on the same
               level as the digitized books and the simple text-only online publications (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss 2020</a>, 103-104). The sole standard
               employed by the author for the texts is, as mentioned above, HTML, offering a solid
               basis. However, this could be improved in the future by using the TEI Guidelines.</p>
<p>Screenshot of the homepage.
               The interface of <em>Catullus Online</em> is quite easy to understand,
               and this format does not require any introductory readings or explanations. However,
               if needed, the user can find a small summary of the various functions of this website
               inside the section “HELP”. The user is directly introduced to the poems in the
               central part of the homepage, whereas on the left part of the website, they can find
               the first part of the navigation bar, – composed of “POEMS”, “POEMS WITH APPARATUS”,
               “BIBLIOGRAPHY”, “TESTIMONIA” – the search tools, and the rest of the navigation bar –
               MANUSCRIPTS”, “ABOUT THE WEBSITE”, “ABOUT THE REPOSITORY”, “CONTACTS”, and “HELP”, as
               shown in <a href="#img4" target="_blank">Figure 4</a>.</p>
<p>Screenshot of Show Full Apparatus detail.
               On the right side of this section, there are only two relevant elements,
               which are the Facebook icon – <em>Catullus Online</em> is very much active on
               Facebook – and the “SHOW FULL APPARATUS” option, which will lead the user from
               “POEMS” to “POEMS WITH APPARATUS”. There, the user can visualize the apparatus in its
               entirety and they can fully visualize various textual phenomena which are
               interconnected with the text (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss
               2020</a>, 107), as shown in <a href="#img5" target="_blank">Figure 5</a>.</p>
<p>As much as this interface is very easy to understand, it is not very
               accessible and usable since reading the text of the poems and their apparatus might
               be a rather tiring task for users. In fact, showcasing the full texts might be a bit
               troubling to read and follow, even more so on a screen with a small font and a high
               density of text.</p>
<p>Screenshot of the three main icons.
               In the section “POEMS WITH APPARATUS”, three icons appear next to the verse
               chosen, as shown in <a href="#img6" target="_blank">Figure 6</a>. The triangle
               icon will make the critical apparatus appear on the right beside the verse studied.
               If the apparatus is longer than one line, the following verse is moved down, so that
               the text can be properly aligned, and the user can fully visualize all the
               conjectures and secondary readings for that specific line without having them overlap
               with the following verse. The rectangle icon, instead, will lead to the visualization
               of the images of the manuscripts at a lower quality, while clicking directly on the
               image will open another window in the browser, showcasing it in a much higher
               resolution and with a larger dimension. The images can also be downloaded, and they
               are extremely precious for the user since they allow them to witness the tradition
               behind Catullus’ poems directly. The quotation mark, on the other hand, will give the
               user further textual and contextual information, and in some cases, it is possible to
               also visualize a cross icon, which offers an overview of the different
               reconstructions of that specific line, also shown in the apparatus. This way, it
               allows a clearer layout separating the reconstructions from the other information
               stored in the apparatus.</p>
<p>Screenshot Search by poems, apparatus, and testimonia
                     option.
               
               
                  
                  Screenshot Go to the passage (poem and line) option.
               It would be rather difficult and time-consuming to browse through the
               entirety of the collection. Hence, two search tools have been added to allow the user
               to jump directly to the part of the text they want to study.
                  A search box that allows you to search a word inside the poems, the
                     apparatus, or the testimonia (or through all three options); this is very
                     useful because it allows the user to confront various passages in the text with
                     a similar theme or use a specific keyword to see how it is differently used in
                     the text, or its popularity, as shown in Figure 7.
                  The second search tool can be employed, instead, to search a specific
                     paragraph. It will simply jump into a specific poem or line selected, and
                     obviously, in this case, it is important to point out that the user would need
                     to know which specific passage they are searching. This second search tool is a
                     bit faulty since it sometimes either does not work at all or will not jump
                     directly to the poem or line selected, as shown in Figure 8.</p>
<p>Screenshot of the alphabetic order of the Bibliography
                     section.
               To also facilitate the navigation of the “BIBLIOGRAPHY” page, the author has
               organized the bibliography through quick links to individual letters, alphabetically
               ordered, as shown in <a href="#img9" target="_blank">Figure 9</a>.</p>
<p>All the rights of this project – the author’s research, his work on the
               text, and the website – are copyrighted by Dániel Kiss (<a href="#kiss2013_2017" target="_blank">2013, 2017</a>). For the images, instead, all the rights
               belong to the institution hosting the photographed manuscripts. The
                  <em>Bibliothèque Nationale de France</em> has given the permission to
               reproduce digitally the images of the manuscripts T and G, whereas the <em>Bodleian
                  Library</em> at first requested a small fee for the publication of the images of
               O, but now they are freely available on the <em>Digital Bodleian</em> (<a href="#mastronarde2020" target="_blank">Mastronarde 2020</a>, 116-117).</p>
<p>The website is not hosted on an institutional site, although that is
               something that Kiss hopes to obtain in the future since it would make the site much
               more stable and durable in time. Currently, he has been paying an annual fee to
               Woodpecker Software for the domain rights of <em>Catullus Online</em>. The
               platform is accessible from every kind of browser, although in the future,
               technological change problems might prove to be rather intense for the website, even
               more for mobile users since a responsive version has not been developed yet and a
               printed edition is not available (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss
                  2020</a>, 109-112).</p>
<p>It is also important to state that the content and rendering of the
               website are tightly linked, which appears to be quite a limitation for the project as
               it does not allow the ordinary user to consult the project offline, and neither can
               they store the texts and apparatus elsewhere to properly annotate them. It would be
               good in the future to study a solution that would allow the users to access the
               website differently, without relying entirely on its rendering, and by allowing the
               possibility to download the apparatus and texts or even just simply mark the texts
               with their annotations.</p>
<p>In the future, it is also important to review the content of
                  <em>Catullus Online</em> since, over the years, growing feedback from the
               users has been collected. This could be useful to update the edition with newfound
               conjectures and ideas, and this was possible thanks to the presence of <em>Catullus
                  Online</em> on Facebook, which has proved to be extremely useful for the first
               years of the website since it allowed the editor to promote it in groups about
               classics and digital humanities (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss
                  2020</a>, 109).</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Conclusion</h3>
<p>According to Patrick Sahle’s definition, <em>Catullus Online</em> is
               a Scholarly Edition, a “critical representation of historic documents” (<a href="#sahle2016" target="_blank">Sahle 2016</a>, 23). The choices regarding
               the reproduction of the text and the additional material chosen to portray the
               historical tradition behind Catullus’ poems are explained, justified, and stated by
               the editor through specific editorial methods and based on academic studies that are
               respected throughout the entire edition. The historical aspect of this edition, on
               the other hand, is visible in the apparatus and the “MANUSCRIPT” section where the
               user can fully witness the diachronic dimension of Catullus’ tradition, being able to
               bridge the distance in time directly. There is also a full representation of the
               subject and all the self-stated rules – e.g., to offer a way to freely access the
               conjectures, to collect as many conjectures as possible and to give the user some
               extra tools to further understand the context and historical tradition – that are
               respected throughout the entirety of the edition (<a href="#sahle2016" target="_blank">Sahle 2016</a>, 23-26).</p>
<p>It is also a Scholarly <em>Digital</em> Edition but with some
               reservations: it imposes a specific digital paradigm – an algorithm creates a
               specific way to visualize the text (<a href="#sahle2016" target="_blank">Sahle
                  2016</a>, 26-27) – and a specific standard for the texts – HTML. These two
               elements are followed in the entirety of the edition’s creation, but many aspects
               (e.g., “accessibility, usability, and computability”) remain truly underdeveloped.
               Regarding this, I do believe that the lack of models and examples at the time the
               author started working on <em>Catullus Online</em> brought Kiss to have a very
               basic digital model for his project: there is no employment of shared practices such
               as TEI or CTS, and the interface of the website struggles to be responsive and
               accessible.</p>
<p>As stated in the paragraphs above, Catullus Online does certainly offer
               the user a scholarly edition in a digital format, and even though it solves many of
               the problems that come with a printed edition (e.g., the possibility to access the
               texts and the apparatus freely), it still retains some of the typical characteristics
               of printed editions, such as the impossibility to view the edition in different
               formats or the limited responsivity, due to the absence, for example, of an
               infrastructure that adapts to the device the user is employing.</p>
<p>There is certainly a discussion about the digital development of the
               edition, alongside an explanation of all the choices of the author around it,
               furthermore, reinstating a paradigm. However, as Kiss was not the one who worked on
               the technological side – instead, it was a private studio (Woodpecker Software) –
               there is little to no knowledge about the infrastructure hosting the website, hence
               limiting the reusability of such a model for other editions.</p>
<p>This brings the project to be, indeed, digital but at a basic level and
               with many sectors that could be further improved by all the new standards, models,
               and practices developed over the years. Although <em>Catullus Online</em> is not
               digitally perfect, it hopes to be a starting point for the development of further
               studies on Catullus’ tradition (<a href="#kiss2020" target="_blank">Kiss
                  2020</a>, 112-114).</p>
