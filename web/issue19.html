          <h3><a href="issue19/oxygen-framework.html">Untangling Data Complexity: Custom Oxygen Frameworks for Edition Projects</a></h3>
          <div><p>Consistency and coherence in annotated and enriched data are vital to the success of
               any digital edition project. Custom frameworks within the oXygen XML Editor provide a
               user-friendly approach for editors to interact directly with XML data, thus lowering
               entry barriers and ensuring consistency across datasets. Drawing on our experiences as customisers, this review explores the benefits and
               limitations of these custom frameworks, highlighting their potential for
               interdisciplinary teams with varying levels of XML expertise. We critically examine
               the technical requirements for creating and maintaining custom frameworks, as well as
               the current state of documentation. We also discuss challenges that users may face
               with oXygenâ€™s complex interface. Once implemented, frameworks facilitate uniform data
               input, allow for the automation of repetitive annotation tasks, and integrate
               seamlessly with project workflows, thereby enabling users to focus on annotation
               tasks in an environment tailored to the specific needs of each project. In our 
               opinion, despite being underutilised and insufficiently promoted within the
               oXygen platform, custom frameworks offer extensive functionalities that meet the
               needs of a wide variety of edition projects.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue19/tei-publisher.html">TEI Publisher</a></h3>
          <div><p>The TEI Publisher is an open-source tool designed to simplify the
               publication of TEI encoded texts for researchers without extensive programming
               knowledge. It allows users to transform XML data into web-based digital editions
               using predefined templates and custom styles. Developed by eXist-Solutions, it
               integrates with the eXist-db XML database to store and organize data, offering
               flexibility for different use cases. Initially launched in 2015, the tool is under
               continuous development, with regular updates introducing new features and
               improvements. In this review, we examine how TEI Publisher balances ease
               of use with deep customization options. We demonstrate how scholars are empowered to
               produce digital editions rapidly and how researchers can experiment with various
               re-presentations of their data using a graphical interface and a set of predefined
               configurations. We also discuss how, while it lowers barriers for less technical
               users, it nevertheless requires a solid understanding of TEI and proficiency with XML
               technologies for more complex customization. Using a small practical example, we will
               demonstrate some of the core functions of the TEI Publisher and
               highlight both the advantages and drawbacks affecting its presentation and usability.
               TEI Publisher proves to be a mature and easy-to-use tool for projects with moderate
               technical demands, suited for researchers seeking rapid results. However, it falls
               short in accessibility, citability, and adaptability for highly customized use cases,
               revealing areas for future improvement in usability and inclusivity.</p>
