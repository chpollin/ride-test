          <h3 class="h5">Abstract</h3>
          <p>The household account books of the Salzburg merchant family Spängler cover an
               exceptionally long period and constitute a unique source for the history of
               consumption in Central Europe in the eighteenth century. This review assesses the
               diplomatic and database edition that was published by the University of Salzburg and
               partners in 2020. The review focuses on the synergies that the scholarly digital
               edition of the household account books aims to establish between the transcription of
               the books, a database for querying their contents, and a special section containing
               biographical entries about the actors registered in the books. The review shows where
               this combination of editing styles is fruitful, especially for non-narrative sources,
               and where there is scope for further improvements.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721110558/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/" target="_blank">Account Books Spängler Online</a> (Ausgabenbücher Spängler Online, short: ASO;
                  <a href="#reithstoeger2020a" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2020a</a>) are
               a digital edition of four private household accounts of the Salzburg cloth and silk
               merchant Franz Anton Spängler.<span class="note">[Note that the name of the website
                  says ’Haushaltsbücher’, whereas the descriptive title of the website specifies
                  that we are dealing with ‘Ausgabenbücher’, in which only expenses were recorded.
                  In English, the distinction disappears and the source is described as ‘(household)
                  account books’.]</span> The books are part of the collections of the Salzburg City
               Archives and were kept by six family members of different generations (<a href="#reithstoeger2022" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2022</a>, 72-74).
               Reinhold Reith and Georg Stöger (both University of Salzburg) conceptualized,
               managed, and edited the digital edition of the ASO in collaboration with Luisa
               Pichler-Baumgartner, Maria Johanna Falkner, and Katharina Scharf (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105614/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/impressum" target="_blank">Imprint</a>). The digital edition and the database that supports querying its
               contents were published online in June 2020. Reith, Stöger, and their colleagues have
               worked extensively on the Spängler family and the Salzburg merchant community before
                  (<a href="#reith2015" target="_blank">Reith et al. 2015</a>; <a href="#reith2016" target="_blank">Reith et al. 2016</a>). The Austrian Science
               Fund (FWF PUD 10) and some additional organizations funded the <em>in
                  extenso</em> digital publication of the ASO, which was carried out in
               cooperation with the Salzburg City Archives. The technical implementation and design
               were outsourced to a Munich-based consulting company.<span class="note">[Insofar as
                  this can be inferred from the web application itself, the technologies used for
                  presenting the content on the web are CSS and JavaScript. The backend technology
                  used for the different sections of the web application – ‘transcription’,
                  ‘database’, and ‘persons’ – is not specified.]</span></p>
<p>The ASO pursue the synergistic combination of a full diplomatic
               transcription of the source with a (relational) database for querying and computing
               its contents. Their conceptualization differs from that of well-known forms of
               digital text editions. Rather than an index, commentary, and description, a database
               linked with the transcription provides the functionalities for exploring the account
               books. In so doing, the ASO are part of a tradition of publishing non-narrative
               historical sources online. Previous examples of digital editions organized in a
               similar way include the municipal account books of Basel (<a href="#burghartz2015" target="_blank">Burghartz 2015</a>; <a href="#burghartzcalvivogeler2017" target="_blank">Burghartz, Calvi, and Vogeler 2017</a>) and
               the (unfinished) digital edition of the account books of the Loitz merchant family of
               Stettin and Danzig (<a href="#lipinska2019" target="_blank">Lipińska et al.
                  2019</a>). The ASO project associates itself loosely with the emerging
               methodological tradition of combining textual editing with a database but gives no
               details about its technical implementation. Since only few other projects in the
               realm of economic history have pursued the integration of a scholarly digital edition
               (SDE, in the ASO: ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105956/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/transcription" target="_blank">Transcription</a>’) with a relational database for querying its contents (here:
                  ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721110039/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/db" target="_blank">Database</a>’), this is quite unfortunate. This review pays special attention
               to the interaction between transcription and database of the ASO and highlights the
               strengths, challenges, and weaknesses of this approach.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Subject and content of the edition</h3>
<p>The household account books document the daily expenses of members of the
               Spängler family in Salzburg. Their expenses cover a wide variety of topics, ranging
               from birthday presents for family members to wages paid to personnel, maintenance
               costs for carriages, expenditures for food supplies, and much more. The source offers
               much detailed information about the cost of living and wages earned in Salzburg
               during a significant part of the eighteenth century. Within the historiography of
               household account books, which took off in the 1970s (<a href="#reithstoeger2022" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2022</a>, 72-73), the ASO occupy an
               exceptional position. Covering more than 50 years from 1733 until 1785, they have a
               broader scope than earlier editions of private household account books in the German
               realm (for an overview see <a href="#pichlerbaumgartner2016" target="_blank">Pichler-Baumgartner 2016</a>). They contribute a wealth of microdata to ongoing
               research about consumption patterns, household expenditures, and social and family
               relations – topics that are at the core of Reith and Stöger’s research (see e.g. <a href="#reith2015" target="_blank">Reith et al. 2015</a>; <a href="#reith2016" target="_blank">Reith et al. 2016</a>; <a href="#stoeger2019" target="_blank">Stöger 2019</a>; <a href="#reithknapp2021" target="_blank">Reith and Knapp 2021</a>). The ASO also stand out
               against the bulk of the known private household account books, which have their
               origins in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (see <a href="#reithstoeger2022" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2022</a>, 72-73; <a href="#pichlerbaumgartner2016" target="_blank">Pichler-Baumgartner 2016</a>,
               63-77). Thus, the ASO make an important contribution to the history of consumption
               and everyday life in the eighteenth century (<a href="#reithstoeger2022" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2022</a>, 74).</p>
<p>The ASO publish the four household account books of the Spängler family.
               The first book (184 pp.; each scan is one page) covers the period from January 1733
               to June 1750; the second book (186 pp.) runs from June 1750 until January 1761; the
               third (188 pp.) from January 1761 to January 1772 and the fourth (180 pp.) from
               January 1772 to May 1785. Each book was scanned from front to cover. Including the
               pages before the first bookkeeping entry, which are given a negative page number in
               the digital edition, the total number of scans is 754. The series is almost without
               gaps. The editors indicate only three brief interruptions after the death of each of
               Franz Anton Spängler’s three wives. According to the editors, the transcription and
               database contain about 21,000 bookkeeping entries. No sampling procedures have been
               applied. The introduction to the digital edition contains a general bibliography.
               Additionally, each of the biographical entries in the web application contains
               extensive references to literature, published and archival sources. For some of the
               biographical entries, portraits of the persons are included in the web
               application.</p>
<p>The ASO make the data accessible in three different ways, starting from
               the ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105956/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/transcription" target="_blank">Transcription</a>’, the ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721110039/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/db" target="_blank">Database</a>’, or a comprehensive list of ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721110154/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/persons" target="_blank">Persons</a>’ mentioned in the source. Alongside the ‘Introduction’, these are
               the main menu items on the homepage of the digital edition. The first section of the
               web application, ‘Transcription’, provides an enriched transcription of the ASO,
               which is flanked by scans of the original source. In the transcribed text, the names
               of persons are linked to biographical entries, which open in a pop-up window when
               clicked. The list of biographical entries, ‘Persons’, can be accessed separately as
               well and thus constitutes the second way of accessing the data in the ASO. A simple
               mouse-click queries the person against the database and immediately shows all
               mentions of this person in the database entries. The entries themselves provide links
               to the corresponding book/page in the ‘Transcription’ section. In addition to
               searches based on personal names, the ‘Database’ section also supports full-text
               search as well as list-based searches for the categories ‘mode of payment’, ‘type of
               service / occasion / object’, and ‘recipient’. The ‘Database’ section also supports
               queries based on date (from, to), value (min, max), and book/page. The latter can be
               used as a means to access specific pages in the transcription.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Aims and Methods</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105854/https://spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/introduction" target="_blank">introduction to the web application</a> and a recent publication clearly define
               the aims of the ASO (<a href="#reithstoeger2022" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger
                  2022</a>). However, only two sections in the introduction (“About the text
               edition and the database” and “Edition guidelines”) contain information about the
               methods applied during the process. Most of the explanation deals with the database
               and the biographies of the persons mentioned in the account books.</p>
<p>Screenshot of book 1, page 11.
               About the transcription itself, it is said that “[t]he original sequence was
               retained in the text edition in order to document the structure, character and upkeep
               of these account books; that means, even crossouts (insofar as those struck words
               were legible) were reproduced, along with special characters and marginalia.” (<a href="#reithstoeger2020b" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2020b</a>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105956/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/transcription" target="_blank">Transcriptions</a> are displayed next to scans of the transcribed page (see
                  <a href="#img1" target="_blank">fig. 1</a>). Minor modifications were made
               to the transcribed text, mostly for the sake of legibility.<span class="note">[The
                  editors indicate that “[t]he addition of punctuation and completions of shortened
                  declinations, articles and word endings as well as consonants (indicated in the
                  original as a double underlining) were made without comment for the sake of better
                  fluency.” (Introduction).]</span> The original spelling was largely retained. The
               original spelling of the personal names in the account books has also been preserved
               in the transcription, but is linked to a uniform spelling of the person’s name in the
               ‘Persons’ section.</p>
<p>This example page highlights a few particularities of the transcription.
               First, strikethrough of the entire page is not added to the transcription, because it
               is visible on the scan. Second, entries that were crossed out in the account books
               are transcribed as well, but they are not marked as such in the transcription.
               Moreover, they are not included in the database to avoid incorrect calculations.
               Third, abbreviations are written in full, using parentheses to add the abbreviated
               parts of the word, e.g. annor => annor(um). For some words, the abbreviations were
               retained, the “Edition guidelines” indicate that “(…) [t]he abbreviations and
               spellings of Sa (for Summa), pr (for per) and zus (for zusammen, altogether) were
               retained in the transcription.” It is somewhat regrettable that legitimate concerns
               about the legibility of the transcription were not extended to the currencies and
               measures in the text. In the case of currencies, “(…) the standard units x (Kreuzer)
               and f (Gulden) were substituted by xr and fl to facilitate legibility.” (<a href="#reithstoeger2020b" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2020b</a>).
               Furthermore, as indicated in the section “Remarks about the currency and standard
               units”, “[p]ayments in ducats were marked with the abbreviation # [hashtag – W.S.]
               and the converted value (c. 5 fl) was recorded.” (<a href="#reithstoeger2020b" target="_blank">Reith and Stöger 2020b</a>) The sign used for the
               pound is u (u with strikethrough) (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105854/https://spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>). This was probably a pragmatic solution to avoid having to
               deal with the complex issue of the visualization of pre-modern signs for currencies
               and measures, for which – if at all – Unicode equivalents are only scarcely
               available, although the pound sign would not have posed any particular problems.</p>
<p>In contrast with other efforts to improve legibility and computability of
               the source, abbreviated measures are left untouched. The web application only
               provides a general description of its metric equivalents in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105854/https://spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/introduction" target="_blank">introduction</a>. Since the account books are a source for economic historians
               with an interest in the history of consumption, this is remarkable. Looking more
               closely at the weights and measures in the source, some issues become apparent that
               have an impact beyond the realm of historical metrology. For example, one may wonder
               why ‘barrel’ (Fass) is not described in the section on weights and measures, although
               it appears prominently in the list of keywords.</p>
<p>Selection of query results for ‘barrel‘ as ‘type of service /
                     occasion / object’.
               The answer is that, in many cases, the keyword ‘barrel’ was used to annotate
               wages paid to the cooper (see <a href="#img2" target="_blank">fig. 2</a>). The
               next section deals with similar (minor) inconsistencies in more detail.</p>

<section id="div4">
  <h3 class="h5">Publication and presentation</h3>
<p>The user interface is clear and intuitive. The main access methods of
               the scholarly digital edition correspond to the main sections of the web application.
               The interface is relatively easy to navigate as soon as the user understands how the
               different sections are interconnected. The names in the ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105956/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/transcription" target="_blank">Transcription</a>’ are linked to a pop-up window with the corresponding
               information from the ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721110154/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/persons" target="_blank">Persons</a>’ section. The names in the ‘Persons’ section are linked to the
                  ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721110039/https://www.spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/db" target="_blank">Database</a>’ section. In the ‘Database’ section, book and page info link to
               the ‘Transcription’ section, and a mouse-click on a person’s name in the
               ‘Transcription’ makes the corresponding biographical entry from the ‘Persons’ section
               pop-up on the screen.</p>
</section>

<section id="div5">
  <h3 class="h5">Download options</h3>
<p>The web application does not contain any technical interfaces. Download
               options have some limitations. It is impossible to download the entire database
               directly; the number of entries that can be downloaded at once is topped off at
               5,000. Moreover, in the English version of the website the download option only works
               when at least some data is entered in the search mask, for example book and page
               numbers, or dates. With some limitations (not every entry has a date), the date can
               be used as a means for downloading (almost) the entire database in a few steps. Query
               results can be downloaded as Excel files that contain all the items in the database
               display. The Excel sheet also contains an extra field containing the number of the
               scan and one containing the row number of the entry. The number of the scan is
               preceded by a letter indicating the book (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4). Row numbers
               continue across the different account books, starting with 1 for the first row of
               book 1 and ending with 22,951 for the last row of book 4. Since rows without values
               are not included in the database (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220721105854/https://spaengler-haushaltsbuecher.at/introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>), the Excel sheet contains 21,146 rows. Scans can be
               downloaded one by one from the web application, but the quality is not high (96 x 96
               dpi). No information is given about the rights and restrictions for the reuse of text
               and images downloaded from the website.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Conclusions</h3>
<p>The ASO follow a digital paradigm and can be considered a scholarly
               digital edition. The ASO combine a diplomatic with a database edition to improve the
               analysis of the source from the perspective of the history of consumption. The
               editorial guidelines are rather concise, but offer enough information about the
               transcription of the account books. More in-depth information about the structure and
               functions of the database, on the other hand, would have been helpful.</p>
<p>A major strength of the ASO is its clear and intuitive structure that
               makes it easy to explore the source from a variety of perspectives. Despite its
               inconsistencies, the ‘Persons’ section, which provides additional biographical
               information about many people in the account books, is a major asset of the work. The
               way in which the transcription and database sections of the web application are
               connected, has its limitations, but the merits clearly prevail. The ASO provide an
               excellent example of how relatively straightforward digital techniques, such as the
               use of hyperlinks, are leveraged to the benefit of a synergistic digital edition.
               This method could be useful for other non-narrative sources besides the household
               account books. Therefore, it is unfortunate that the ASO remain silent about the
               technical side of the project.</p>
<p>Since its editors embed their work primarily in German-language
               historiography, there is much scope for future research with the ASO. For example, it
               would be interesting to compare the format and contents of the ASO with examples of
               household books in, for example, Great Britain. At first sight, it seems that
               eighteenth-century household books are quite common in British historiography.
               Researchers have used them to discuss consumer behavior, but also to examine changes
               in fashion in the eighteenth century (<a href="#garry2016" target="_blank">Garry
                  2016</a>), the role of second-hand markets in private households, and issues of
               masculinity and the image of women (<a href="#vickery2006" target="_blank">Vickery 2006</a>; <a href="#harvey2012" target="_blank">Harvey 2012</a>).
               The ASO open doors for comparative analyses on these and related topics. Given the
               obvious value of the source, its methods and web application, it would be recommended
               for the editors to get rid of the minor inconsistencies in the application,
               especially in the ‘Persons’ section, and to publish information about the
               technologies used for preparing and publishing this fascinating digital edition.</p>
