          <p>Furnace and Fugue is a digital edition of Michael Maier’s (1568-1622)
                  opus magnum, the emblem book Atalanta fugiens (1617/18)
               in which Latin and German texts are paired with images and musical fugues in an
               enigmatic way to engage users of the book in deep meditation on alchemical subjects.
               The digital edition of the text itself, including an English translation based on a
               17th century manuscript, is accompanied by a number of scholarly essays. A main
               feature is the MEI player, which includes a piano roll visualisation that allows
               users to experience the musicological makeup of Atalanta fugiens even
               without a background in music theory. The edition is a beautifully designed “haute
               couture” edition, intended to provide an example for the future of digital scholarly
               publishing. The project has used digital editing effectively to enable the multimedia
               experience that Michael Maier had likely envisioned for Atalanta
                  fugiens. but which was previously inaccessible to most users of the
               book.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Introduction</h3>
<p><em>Furnace and Fugue</em> is a digital edition of the multimedia emblem book
                  <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> (<a href="#maier1618a" target="_blank">1618a</a>), authored by alchemist Michael Maier (1569-1622).  In addition to
               customary text, this alchemical emblem book also contains a fugue to accompany each
               image. The narrative frame for the collection of fifty emblems is the ancient myth of
               Atalanta and Hippomenes’ race (<a href="#wels2010" target="_blank">Wels
                  2010</a>, 150). Early modern emblematics tend to be meant as food for thought,
               whereby readers (or maybe rather, users) of the emblem book meditate upon the often
               obscure symbolism to get a moral message. Maier’s <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is
               innovative in its adaptation of emblematics for alchemy and in its addition of a
               third layer (music) to the already multi-medial emblematics (consisting of text and
               image). Since both alchemy and emblematics on their own have a reputation of being
               somewhat hard to unriddle, the combination thereof supplies as an ideal source for a
               digital edition, offering lots of opportunities for including additional information,
               data enrichment, or other explanatory resources. More information about
                  <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> can be found in <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> as
               well as all the other many publications on <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> and thus,
               shall not be repeated here in detail.<span class="note">[Almost all research articles
                  on Atalanta fugiens repeat the same information describing how the book is set up,
                  so this information can easily be gathered from those sources.]</span> This
                  review<span class="note">[The reviewer’s academic background is in Classics
                  (Neo-Latin), history of science (esp. alchemy) as well as the Digital Humanities.

               <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> is a project providing “A Digital Edition of Michael
               Maier’s Atalanta fugiens (1618) with Scholarly Commentary” (<a href="#nummedal_bilak2020a" target="_blank">Nummedal and Bilak 2020a</a>), the first
               born-digital monograph by Brown University Digital Publications (<a href="#img1" target="_blank">fig. 1</a> and <a href="#img2" target="_blank">2</a>).
               Eight interdisciplinary interpretative essays (<a href="#bianchi2020" target="_blank">Bianchi 2020</a>; <a href="#bilak2020" target="_blank">Bilak 2020</a>; <a href="#forshaw2020" target="_blank">Forshaw 2020</a>;

                  <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>. Not only is this project unique because
                  <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is such a unique book and there has never been a
               multimedia edition for it before, but realising the author’s likely intentions, it is
               also still one of the first major digital editions in the context of alchemy
               research. Digital scholarly editing is not yet a common practice in the
               historiography of alchemy (<a href="#martinontorres2011" target="_blank">Martinón-Torres
                  2011</a>, 233), but minimal editions of TEI-encoded transcriptions of alchemical
               texts and their image facsimiles do exist.<span class="note">[Examples are: Maier 1617a, 1617b, 2009.]</span> First digital edition projects have already been realised
               in the context of alchemy research, such as <em>The Chymistry of Isaac
                  Newton</em> (<a href="#newman2009" target="_blank">Newman 2009</a>) or the
                  <em>Making and Knowing project</em> (<a href="#smith2020" target="_blank">Smith 2020</a>).<span class="note">[The 2009 Newton digital edition is
                  currently being updated but beyond a number of tweets, no definitive information
                  with more details has yet been published about it: https://twitter.com/alextheknitter/status/12555713769934397452020-04-29).]</span>
               However, digital editions have not yet become a standard in alchemy research despite
               their unique suitedness for complex alchemical texts (<a href="#martinontorres2011" target="_blank">Martinón-Torres 2011</a>, 233).</p>
<p><em>Furnace and Fugue</em> originated in co-editor Donna Bilak’s postdoctoral
               research at the Chemical Heritage Foundation (now Science History Institute,
               Philadelphia/PA) in 2013-2014, where it was further developed in a 2015 workshop and
               at a later 2016 Brown University workshop.<span class="note">[https://dbilakpraxis.com/project-atalanta/ further testify the creation

  <h3 class="h5">Atalanta Fugiens, 1617/18</h3>
<p>Michael Maier (1568-1622) was a German iatrochymist (‘alchemist and
               doctor’) recognized for a number of alchemical publications in the early 17th
               century. Among his works, the alchemical emblem book <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>
                  (<a href="#maier1618a" target="_blank">1618a</a>) stands out, as it is
               described as “one of the most beautiful books of alchemical literature of all time”
                  (<a href="#figala_neumann1989" target="_blank">Figala and Neumann 1989</a>,
               49-50). Since the seminal 1969 study by Helena M. E. De Jong, <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> is considered the masterpiece of Maier’s oeuvre, probably because
               of its unusual multimedia combination of text, image, and music (<a href="#leibenguth2002" target="_blank">Leibenguth 2002</a>, 5-6).<span class="note">[De Jong
                  provided an overview of the sources for the mottos in Maier’s emblems in Jong 2002, 330-33.]</span></p>
<p>Despite the fact that the whole range of possible interpretations of
               Maier’s multimedia masterpiece will probably never run out,<span class="note">[As
                  Principe argues: “Although the original sources of the imagery lie in earlier
                  texts, Maier augments them with further connections, allusions, and meanings of
                  his own. The epigrams are so intricate that it seems unlikely that any one reader
                  would ever ‘get’ all the references, allusions, connections, and puns.” In: Principe 2013, 174.]</span> there
               is consensus that Maier intended to promote alchemy in the context of courtly
               education and entertainment, for which emblems surely were an ideal medium.<span class="note">[Figala and Neumann write: “In general, Maier pursued the aim in his
                  published books of raising and maintaining alchemy in the opinion of the educated
                  public. He strove expressly to give it the rank in the contemporary hierarchy of
                  sciences that he thought it deserved. It should stand, as the noblest of the
                  scholarly disciplines, directly after theology, for its subject-matter is the
                  investigation of the greatest secrets of God’s creation. [...] A way the poeta
                  laureatus Maier found to bring Chymia nearer to the educated public was by
                  glorifying it in poetry. With this purpose he wrote not only three Latin poetic
                  cycles, but also his best-known work and certainly one of the most beautiful books
                  of alchemical literature of all time, the Atalanta fugiens, first printed in
                  1617.” In: Figala and Neumann
                     1989, 49-50. Also, Principe: “In contrast to Basil Valentine’s organised
                  sequence of ‘keys’ that expound a single text and encode a single process, Maier’s
                  Atalanta fugiens is a florilegium of images. It collects imagery and expressions
                  from an array of earlier authors – Hermes, Morienus, Valentine, and others – and
                  assembles them into one of the most intricate and rich layerings of meaning to be
                  found in chymistry. Even though Maier probably did perform some laboratory work,
                  his Atalanta fugiens lies much further from the world of laboratory practice than
                  do the books of Valentine or George Starkey. (Some readers, including Sir Isaac
                  Newton, nevertheless mined it for practical information about making the
                  Philosophers’ Stone.)” In: Principe
                     2013, 174.]</span> In their introduction to <em>Furnace and
               Fugue</em>, Nummedal and Bilak state:
                  Maier [...] sought to elevate alchemy above its grubby artisanal roots,
                     establishing it as a humanist, philosophical, emblematic, courtly art with the
                     potential to access nature’s arcana. On this count Atalanta
                        fugiens certainly succeeds, demonstrating that alchemy offered not
                     just precious medicines or metals but also fodder for mathematical games,
                     musical riddles, artistic virtuosity, and classical erudition. (Nummedal and Bilak 2020b)</p>
<p>Some have even interpreted Maier’s <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a
               turn away from alchemical practice to the use of alchemical symbolism for poetic
               ends, merely repurposing existing material from earlier alchemical compendia as his
               poetic material (<a href="#wels2010" target="_blank">Wels 2010</a>, 2013).
               While claims have been made that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> lacks practical
               chemistry, no detailed explanations are provided to support these assertions.<span class="note">[Figala and Neumann conclude: “It has been said that this book
                  contains ‘no instructions at all for alchemical practice’. This is certainly true,
                  and much the same might be said about all Maier’s published works.” In: Figala and Neumann 1989, 50.
                  See also Principe 2013,
                  174-79.]</span> In fact, Rainer Werthmann has offered chemical explanations for
               several emblems within the book.<span class="note">[Werthmann 2011, 214-26 covers
                  emblems 24, 28, 34, 37, and 44. Another article by Rainer Werthmann on chemical
                  interpretations of Atalanta fugiens will appear in the proceedings Michael Maier
                  und die Formen (al)chemischen Wissens um 1600 (Volkhard Wels & Simon Brandl,
                  eds.) titled Chemisches Wissen in Michael Maiers Atalanta fugiens.]</span> Lawrence
               Principe characterises the work as follows: 
                  It can thus be seen as part of the wider tradition of apologies of alchemy
                     in which Maier uses the poetry, music, learned play, and beautiful images of
                     his book to link chymistry to the liberal and the fine arts. His purpose, then,
                     is not simply to entertain readers but rather to ennoble a practice generally
                     considered dirty and laborious by making it attractive to humanist
                     contemporaries. [...] Atalanta fugiens is one instance of
                     continuing attempts to address chymistry’s shaky cultural and intellectual
                     position – an issue that plagued chymists from the Middle Ages through the
                     eighteenth century. (Principe
                        2013, 176-78)On the general topic see: Principe 2013,
                        174-79.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> stands as Maier’s most
               extensively researched work, attracting numerous re-editions and articles written
               about it.<span class="note">[On Atalanta fugiens (choice): Jong 2002; Szönyi 2003; Hlaváček
                     2006; Hofmeier 2007;
                     Purš 2007; Wels 2010; Nummedal and Bilak 2020a, 2020b.]</span> While some of
               these publications primarily admire the uniqueness and peculiarity of Maier’s emblems
               without adding new insights, others provide valuable contributions to emblem studies
                  (<a href="#rola1988" target="_blank">Rola 1988</a>; <a href="#gaudio2020" target="_blank">Gaudio 2020</a>; <a href="#wagner2021" target="_blank">Wagner 2021</a>). Furthermore, a number of publications revolving around the
               topic of ‘alchemy and music’ exist, most of which at least mention Maier’s
                  <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.<span class="note">[For example: Sleeper 1938; Sawyer 1966; Rebotier 1972; Meinel 1986; Kelkel 1987; Streich 1989; Godwin 1989; Eijkelboom 1990; Raasveld 1994; Hasler 2011; Limbeck 2019.]</span>
               <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> could build on the source critical work of De Jong,
               her English translation and contextual information as well as the Hofmeier edition
               with its abundant indices (<a href="#jong2002" target="_blank">Jong 2002</a>;
                  <a href="#hofmeier2007" target="_blank">Hofmeier 2007</a>; rez. <a href="#smith2009" target="_blank">Smith 2009</a>; <a href="#tilton2011" target="_blank">Tilton 2011</a>). Beyond its multimedia
                  aspects, <em>Atalanta fugiens’</em>enduring popularity was probably the
               primary motivation for creating an edition of this book of Maier’s rather than
               another. And, as the various contributions in <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> testify,
               there is still much left to be said about it.<span class="note">[From a
                  historiographical standpoint, one may question the editors’ decision to re-edit
                  Maier’s most well-famous work when there would have been a large number of less
                  well researched works of Maier’s left that might have benefited more from in-depth
                  study. Especially as it seems likely that better knowledge of those works would be
                  critical for the interpretation of Atalanta fugiens, which – due to its highly

<p>With its gorgeous design,<em>Furnace and Fugue</em>
               <span class="note">[The bibliographic citation of the edition is: Nummedal and Bilak
                  2020a.]</span> exemplifies what Elena Pierazzo refers to as an ‘haute
               couture’ digital edition (<a href="#pierazzo2019" target="_blank">Pierazzo
                  2019</a>), a term to describe editions “which are tailored to the specific needs
               of specific scholars” (<a href="#pierazzo2019" target="_blank">Pierazzo
                  2019</a>, 209) using significant amounts of funding. The editors assert in their
               introduction that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> had never before been discussed in
               such a multidisciplinary manner (<a href="nummedal_bilak2020b" target="_blank">Nummedal and Bilak
                  2020b</a>). <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>allows modern audiences, perhaps for
               the first time, to experience <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> in the way it may have
               been intended by the author. The editors state that De Jong’s fundamental 1969 study,
               which focused on source criticism, deflected attention from the unique multimedia
               combination that is <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, reducing it to a traditionally
               text-centered approach. <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> aims fill this gap and explore
               neglected aspects, such as the relationships between images, texts, and music, in an
               interdisciplinary context ().  Additionally, the edition seeks to bridge the gap in
               knowledge between Maier’s intended audience, erudite Humanistic polymaths, and modern
               users. <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> makes Michael Maier’s unique multimedia emblem
               book more accessible in multiple ways: On the one hand, the scholarly articles
               addressing open questions of Maier research make this edition relevant for a
               scholarly audience (<a href="#bianchi2020" target="_blank">Bianchi 2020</a>;

               On the other hand, three introductory essays on alchemy, Maier, and letter-press
               printing provide just enough background to let an interested public partake in the
               exploration of this unique remnant of early modern culture (<a href="#rampling2020" target="_blank">Rampling 2020</a>; <a href="#tilton2020" target="_blank">Tilton 2020</a>; <a href="#tabor2020" target="_blank">Tabor 2020</a>).</p>
<p>In the following, we will proceed to explore the project website in the
               order of the different options in the navigation bar (‘Digital Edition’, ‘Essays’,
               ‘Images’, and ‘Contents’). Clicking on ‘Digital Edition’<span class="note">[Nummedal and Bilak 2020a:

               Above the emblem images, there are text links to the parts of <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> that do not have accompanying images, such as the title page,
               author’s epigram, dedication, and preface. However, from a usability standpoint, this
               design is not ideal as it may cause readers to overlook other parts of Maier’s text.
               It also hinders accessing the book in a traditional manner, where one would start
               from the beginning and navigate through the pages (which Nummedal terms the
               ‘horizontal mode’ in <a href="#nummedal2020" target="_blank">Nummedal

               Donna Bilak frames <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a case of playful
               encipherment typical of early modern courtly entertainment (<a href="#img14" target="_blank">fig. 14</a>, <a href="#img15" target="_blank">15</a>, and
                  <a href="#img16" target="_blank">16</a>): She argues that the fifty emblems
               can be interpreted as a magic square following Agrippa of Nettesheim’s writings (<a href="#bilak2020" target="_blank">Bilak 2020</a>). Michael Gaudio examines the
               landscapes depicted in the background of Merian’s etchings, interpreting them as a
               commentary on the measurement of nature, thereby inviting users of the book to look
               more closely (<a href="#gaudio2020" target="_blank">Gaudio 2020</a>). Tara
               Nummedal interprets <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> as a reflection of Maier’s
               perspective on different types of reading (<a href="#img17" target="_blank">fig.
                  17</a> and <a href="#img18" target="_blank">18</a>): <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> invites readers to engage in both the ‘horizontal mode’, i.e.
               quickly turning pages and viewing the emblems in context, but also the ‘vertical
               mode’ encouraging in-depth study of individual pages and thereby engaging different
               modes of meaning-making. The digital edition reflects this theory in the affordances
               it offers to its users (<a href="#nummedal2020" target="_blank">Nummedal
                  2020</a>).</p>
<p>Richard Oosterhoff discusses allusions to mathematics such as the
               squaring of the circle in Maier’s earlier tract <em>De Circulo Physico
                  Quadrato</em> (1616), explaining it as a problem that cannot be solved by theory
               alone, but only by a practitioner able to combine ‘ratio’ and ‘experientia’<em>,</em>highlighting the importance of practical expertise alongside theory. Craftsmen
               are, as Maier suggests, ‘squaring circles’ all the time in their everyday practice by
               approximation while the problem remains unsolvable to theorists. Maier likely means
               to insinuate that the same is true for gold-making, framing it as a solution that is
               theoretically knowable, just not yet known, exactly like Aristotle had framed the
               squaring of the circle (<a href="#oosterhoff2020" target="_blank">Oosterhoff
                  2020</a>). Peter Forshaw discusses Maier’s mythoalchemy, comparing his
               mythoalchemical text <em>Arcana Arcanissima</em> (1614) with the mythoalchemical
               emblems of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> (<a href="#forshaw2020" target="_blank">Forshaw 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Performance edition of Atalanta fugiens (as PDF).
               The most groundbreaking revelation in <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> is that
               forty of the fifty fugues were copied from John Farmers <em>Divers & Sundry
                  Waies</em> (1591), as Loren Ludwig demonstrates (<a href="#ludwig2020" target="_blank">Ludwig 2020</a>). Contrary to the original assumption that
               Maier composed most of the fugues himself, this discovery places <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> in the reception line of an English crypto-catholic liturgical
               tradition but also raises questions about the role of the fugues in Maier’s overall
               work. While a crypto-catholic intention does not seem likely given Maier’s otherwise
               undoubtedly Lutheran faith, the reuse of those fugues underscores Maier’s belief in
               music as an alternative, yet equally suitable transmission medium for secret
               knowledge, be it spiritual or alchemical. Furthermore, Eric Bianchi suggests in his
               essay that <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> is unlikely to have been intended for
               performance but rather as an invitation to silent contemplation in the context of
               contemporary music theory – an ideal that Maier later realised in his
                  <em>Cantilenae Intellectuales</em> (1622). Bianchi further notes that
               composing music and possessing theoretical knowledge of music theory were markers of
               belonging to the courtly elite, the intended audience for Maier’s book, unlike
               playing music which was the task of skilled artisans (<a href="#bianchi2020" target="_blank">Bianchi 2020</a>). Nonetheless, <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> can certainly be performed, as demonstrated by the music player in
               the digital edition and the performance edition (<a href="#img19" target="_blank">fig. 19</a>) created in the <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> project (<a href="#nummedal_bilak2020a" target="_blank">Nummedal and Bilak 2020a</a>).<span class="note">[The music edition can be found under this: https://furnaceandfugue.org/back-matter/music-performance/furnace-fugue-music-edition.pdf.
                  The performance edition is a PDF version of Atalanta fugiens intended for singers
                  who want to print out the sheet music for performing it.]</span></p>
<p>While these contributions significantly enhance current research,
               particularly the insights regarding Maier’s fugues, central questions concerning
                  <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> remain unanswered to this day, such as the absence
               of a critical edition or a chemical commentary.<span class="note">[Another edition

  <h3 class="h5">Furnace and Fugue and digital editing practices</h3>
<p>Part of the Brown Digital Publishing Initiative, <em>Furnace and
                  Fugue</em> serves as a commentary on generating reputation, trustworthiness, and
               credibility in digital publishing, particularly within the context of digital
               scholarly editions. It combines practices from both digital scholarly editions and
               digital scholarly publications, positioning itself as a first-born digital monograph
               that includes a text edition but differs from other digital scholarly editions in
               significant ways. To understand <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> and its place within
               the Digital Humanities and digital scholarly editing community, it is essential to
               consider its context in the Mellon Digital Publishing Initiative grant. This
               initiative aims to develop new models for digital publications, primarily focused on
               making traditional scholarly peer-reviewed publications accessible as digital
               open-access editions while maintaining credibility within the traditional framework
               of tenure requirements. It does not directly derive from the Digital Humanities
               tradition of digital scholarly editing like it is usually reflected upon in reviews
               in this journal. This important information for understanding the institutional
               context of <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> can only be gleaned by listening to a
               number of podcasts, interviews, and online talks given by the editors and
               collaborators of the <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> project (<a href="#newbooksnetwork2020" target="_blank">New Books Network 2020</a>; <a href="#cocks2021" target="_blank">Cocks 2021</a>). It might make sense to include a brief note
               on this in the ‘Backmatter’ of the digital edition, alongside other project
               information.</p>
<p>Through these circumstances, <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> serves as an
               intriguing commentary on digital editions. On one hand, the project seeks to promote
               digital open-access publishing and align such publications with traditional academic
               expectations by partnering with a reputable publisher, the University of Virginia
               Press. This approach prioritises ‘extrinsic’means of garnering reputation rather
               than fully utilising quality standards of the digital scholarly editing community,
               i.e., quality standards for digital editing as discussed frequently in this journal
               but that <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>does not make full use of (such as opting for
               the IconClass tagging system instead of a custom one to enhance interoperability or
               providing a critical edition of the text represented in the edition).<span class="note">[It is worth discussing briefly why this may present problems. Does
                  a digital edition only hold value if it receives approval from a traditional
                  press? Does this impose further restrictions on scholars engaged in scholarly
                  editing? The involvement of a tenured professor at Brown University, along with
                  the support of the Mellon Foundation and Brown Digital Publishing Initiative,
                  highlights the privilege associated with such projects. Does this potentially set
                  a precedent for other scholars interested in publishing digitally, requiring them
                  to collaborate with prestigious presses, a practice rather uncommon in the world
                  of digital scholarly editing? Does this implicitly suggest that a digital edition
                  itself is not a reputable or serious publication? In fact, the digital scholarly
                  editing community offers various quality assurance measures, both ‘extrinsic’
                  (such as this journal or the Reviews in DH journal), and ‘intrinsic’ by adhering
                  to best practices in digital scholarly editing. These measures are intended to
                  ensure quality assurance and prevent digital editions from being perceived as
                  inferior to traditional print editions.Such concerns may have been understandable
                  at a time when digital scholarly editing was less prevalent and online sources
                  still carried a stench of untrustworthiness. However, one would expect that in
                  2020, a year where the necessity of ‘going digital’ became even more evident in
                  academia, even in previously less digital spaces due to the global pandemic, this
                  would no longer be a topic of discussion. As a member of the Digital Humanities
                  community, one would assume that a digital edition is not viewed as inferior, even
                  in the initial years of the project (2015/7). If anything, participating in or
                  leading a digital project should be considered an asset for one’s Curriculum
                  Vitae, as indicated in the podcasts where the editors discuss the motivation
                  behind Furnace and Fugue (New
                     Books Network 2020, Cocks
                     2021). Then again, this might serve to put into relief the contrast which
                  still exists between the Digital Humanities and more traditionally-minded scholars
                  with regards to digital scholarly editing. Admittedly, these statements were only
                  made in more informal outlets such as interviews or podcasts, not reflected in the
                  narrative on the website itself. However, it remains crucial to pay close
                  attention to the rhetoric employed in digital edition projects, particularly those
                  claiming to serve as flagship examples for inspiring future best
               practices.]</span></p>
<p>However, the self-fashioning of the project as a digital publishing
               pioneer may be explained by the unmentioned focus on creating a digital publication,
               that is a digitally-enhanced, peer-reviewed, open-access edited collection rather
               than a digital scholarly edition of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> itself. While these
               decisions are valid, they could have been explicitly stated in the project
               description. Given the project’s aim to develop high-quality digital publications
               deserving the same respect as print equivalents, it still seems a bit unusual that
               more interest was not extended to the digital scholarly edition of <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em>. The methodology of scholarly editing, digital or otherwise, has
               long been accepted as a means of ensuring quality and reputation for text editions.
               The title of the digital publication “a Digital Edition [...] with Scholarly
               Commentary” (<a href="#nummedal_bilak2020b" target="_blank">Nummedal and Bilak 2020b</a>),
               though probably carefully chosen, may be considered somewhat misleading since
               scholars trained in text editing or textual philology would expect that commentary to
               relate directly to the text. According to a more traditional definition of a
               scholarly commentary, the articles provide inter- and multidisciplinary
               interpretations of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, not a commentary of the text
               itself. The title of the introduction, “Interplay. New Scholarship on <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em>” (), confirms just that suspicion – that <em>Furnace and
                  Fugue</em> is not primarily a digital scholarly edition of <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> but rather, provides new scholarship on <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> while at the same time making the text and facsimiles easily
               accessible online.</p>

<section id="div9">
  <h3 class="h5">Furnace and Fugue as a digital edition</h3>
<p>The editors emphasise the fact that <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> is
               the first truly interdisciplinary resource on <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, yet, its
               unique contribution pertains mainly to the area of musicology. This is reflected both
               in the edition of the source text itself, featuring an innovative MEI Viewer/Player,
               which allows even a lay audience to playfully explore the musical composition, and in
               the scholarly essays, which contribute consequential new insights mostly with regard
               to Maier’s fugues. While the other essays explore interesting aspects, they do not
               fundamentally change our understanding of <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> but rather
               expand on existing discussions. The team was certainly interdisciplinary, yet as to
               the pertinent question of why there was not a historian of chemistry involved, the
               project website remains silent.<span class="note">[Historians of chemistry, such as
                  Lawrence Principe, seem to have acted as consultants at some stage of the project
                  or at least participated in the 2015 and 2016 workshops. This criticism may have
                  been anticipated and thus addressed with an explanation as to why the decision was
                  made to not include such a central aspect.]</span></p>
<p>Despite its other merits, which are plentiful, <em>Furnace and
                  Fugue</em> could have done a better job of being more critical of its sources
               (the 17th century translation) and tailoring the resource for the needs of a
               scholarly audience (making footnotes more easily accessible in the scholarly essays).
               It is suggested that a note regarding the translation as well as a ‘show all
               footnotes’ button should be added to remedy these issues. As a third main issue, the
               long-term archiving situation is not clear and there is no statement on the data
               management plan.</p>
<p>While <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> excels in visual presentation and
               interactive aspects, it falls short in textual criticism as it lacks a critical
               edition. While it is understandable that <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> opted to
               focus on aspects previous editions had paid less attention to (images and music), the
               text is still one of the three core elements of Maier’s multimedia work (text, image,
               music). Despite the significant scholarly interest in <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>,
               the text itself remains incompletely understood, lacking a commentary or
               comprehensive textual analysis. The absence of a critical edition or deeper
               engagement with the text is regrettable and leaves a sense of incompleteness.
               However, this was a deliberate decision by the editors, who have successfully
               achieved the goals they set for this digital edition of <em>Atalanta
               fugiens</em>.</p>
<p>Introductory text by Hereward Tilton with map
                     visualization.
               Classifying <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> as a digital scholarly edition is
               somewhat challenging since it does not provide a critical edition of <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em> per se, although it does offer scholarly essays on the subject.
               Thus, one could say that it meets the criteria of being both a digital edition and a
               scholarly resource. The map included in Tilton’s introduction, for instance, does a
               convincing job of visualising Maier’s travels, however, this particular feature does
               not truly lose its usefulness when given in print form (<a href="#img23" target="_blank">fig. 23</a>). Then again, Digital Humanities scholars are
               probably not the primary target audience, as certain notable features, such as the
               ability to create personal emblem collections and interactive rearrangement, are not
               highlighted in the documentation as the noteworthy features they are. <em>Furnace
                  and Fugue</em>includes interactive digital features that cannot be replicated
               in print, suggesting its classification as a digital scholarly edition.<span class="note">[On criteria for classifying resources as digital scholarly
                  editions: Sahle 2016.]</span></p>
<p>Potential future work for <em>Furnace and Fugue</em>includes
               integrating the image search with Emblematica Online or similar sources. This would
               entail tagging the images according to the IconClass guidelines for easier comparison
               of potential visual inspirations. The text could benefit from a philological approach
               and a text-critical edition, providing explanations of visual motifs and sources
               directly on the text in the form of a traditional commentary. Having to retrieve and
               reassemble the information scattered throughout scholarly essays makes it hard to
               form one’s own interpretation of the text. Additionally, integrating the sources
               identified by De Jong or providing an easily searchable overview of De Jong’s
               findings would be valuable (<a href="#jong2002" target="_blank">Jong 2002</a>,
               330-33), maybe even linking to the sources of relevant facsimiles available online.
               Further research could explore the chemical interpretations of <em>Atalanta
                  fugiens</em>, as done in Werthmann.<span class="note">[Werthmann 2011, 214-26 covers
                  emblems 24, 28, 34, 37, and 44.]</span> Many publications suggest that this topic
               is already dealt with yet there are hardly any publications explaining why this
               supposedly is so.</p>
<p>While <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> has a beautifully designed layout
               and a collaboration with a traditional publishing house, it could enhance the user
               experience by providing more transparent information about its sources, such as the
               17th century English translation, and improving the accessibility of footnotes in
               scholarly essays. While the resource offers diplomatic and normalised transcriptions
               of the Latin-German original book and its 17th century English translation, textual
               scholars may desire a critical apparatus or commentary at the word or sentence level.
               The scholarly essays provide interpretations but do not constitute a philological or
               text-critical edition as implied by the project title.</p>
<p>Additionally, the long-term archiving situation and data management plan
               require clarification. The insights gained from the project should be published in a
               Digital Humanities publication to make them accessible to the wider community and
               ensure preservation for the future, involving both the editors as well as the
               technical leads of the project.  Such a publication could summarise some of the
               information which can now be found by listening to a number of podcasts on the
               project but also explain decisions made in the process of creating this publication
               in more detail, especially with regards to experimenting with ways to handle the
               multimediality of the sources, potential reuse scenarios (and a long-term archiving
               plan) for the data and libraries created for the project. Furthermore, it would be
               great to have a deeper description of the digital aspects of the project which goes
               beyond the brief project description (backmatter/about). Overall, <em>Furnace and
                  Fugue</em> is a stunning project that provides a valuable platform for both the
               general public and scholars to explore <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Conclusion</h3>
<p><em>Furnace and Fugue</em> is the first born-digital monograph by Brown
               University Digital Publications, consisting of eight interpretative essays, three
               introductory texts, and a digital edition of the early modern emblem book
                  <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> (1618a), including a MEI-based music player, using
               which individual voices can be isolated for analysis and demonstration, an invaluable
               feature for lectures or educational presentations. The edition shines in its elegant
               visual presentation and interactive capabilities. For instance, the feature to create
               personalised emblem collections is significant, allowing focused, individualised
               study. Additionally, the image search functionality lets users dive deeply into the
               material, even if it could benefit from integration into existing emblem databases
               and search engines to facilitate even broader comparative studies. Particularly
               noteworthy is the innovative MEI Viewer/Player, which opens new vistas for
               understanding Maier’s intricate fusion of music with alchemical thought, allowing
               even those without a music theory background to engage deeply with the fugues. The
               feature not only empowers academic scrutiny but also extends the project’s appeal to
               a broader audience.</p>
<p>A flagship project and ‘haute couture’ digital edition, <em>Furnace
                  and Fugue</em> pushes the boundaries of multimedia publication in the
               historiography of alchemy. Nummedal and Bilak have seamlessly blended the realms of
               digital scholarly edition and digital scholarly publication, with the edition being
               accompanied by essays from various disciplines. In the context of alchemy research,
               where digital scholarly editions are still relatively few, <em>Furnace and
                  Fugue</em> is an innovative project, taking its place alongside the only two
               other major digital editions, the 2009 pioneering <em>Chymistry of Isaac
                  Newton</em> project (<a href="#newman2009" target="_blank">Newman
               2009</a>) and the influential <em>Making and Knowing</em> project (2014-2021,
                  <a href="#smith2020" target="_blank">Smith 2020</a>). The comprehensive and
               interactive digital platform realises the multimedia experience likely envisioned by
               Maier for <em>Atalanta fugiens</em>, a feature hitherto inaccessible to most
               users of the book. In sum, <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> enriches scholarship on
               early modern alchemy and on the chymist Michael Maier. It sets a precedent in its
               multidisciplinary approach and multimedia digital edition. It represents a
               significant leap forward in understanding Maier’s multimedia vision and its
               implications for his alchemical thought.</p>
