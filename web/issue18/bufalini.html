          <p>Paolo Bufalini’s Notebook (from here on PBN) is a critical edition of
               the personal notebook that the Italian politician and intellectual Paolo Bufalini
               held from 1981 to 1991. The edition offers the opportunity to plunge into the flow of
               thoughts of a man of the twentieth century who reflects on philosophy, poetry, and
               politics. The methodical goal of this edition, which is implemented with XML/TEI and
               RDF graphs, is to create an encoding system using Semantic Web technologies, able to
               emphasize the complex network of quotations and annotations that fills the pages. The
               digital edition aims to follow a data-centric paradigm. In this light, PBN is
               connected to authority files and external knowledge bases, such as DBpedia, VIAF, and
               WorldCat, to harness the power of the Linked Open Data universe. This review provides
               the reader with an overview of Paolo Bufalini’s work and the main features of the
               semantic critical edition. Finally, PBN can be evaluated as a decent edition, which
               responds to certain requirements of a digital edition, but not to all, and it still
               lends itself to improvements and new developments.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Introduction to the author</h3>
<p>Paolo Bufalini (Rome, 9 September 1915 – Rome, 19 December 2001) was an
               Italian communist partisan, an excellent critical observer of history, and a master
               of alliance politics. Assigned to international relations, he played the role of a
               mediator between the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the Vatican for many years. He
               was a senator from 1963 to 1992. Bufalini was a Latinist and a translator of Horace.
               He was a humanist before being a politician. His readings and his dedication to
               literature and philosophy, as the content of the notebook shows, saved him from an
               all-encompassing political involvement. The former president of Italy Giorgio
               Napolitano, commemorating Bufalini, his friend and party colleague, remembers him as
               among “le migliori energie delle generazioni dell’antifascismo, della Guerra e della
                  Resistenza”<span class="note">[“the best energies of the generations of
                  anti-fascism, War and Resistance” translated by the author of this review.]</span>
                  (<a href="#matteoli2002" target="_blank">Matteoli 2002</a>, 25). Although he
               is considered one of the most influential personalities in Italian politics of the
               last century, there is no significant documentary footage about him. Aside from the
               monograph curated by Giovanni Matteoli in 2002 and published by Rubbettino Editore
               (see <a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">Citti 2008</a>), the PBN appears
               currently the widest editorial project focused on the <em>red cardinal</em>, as
               he was nicknamed.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Introduction to the digital edition</h3>
<p>The digital edition of <em>Quaderno di appunti di Paolo Bufalini
                  (1981-1991), Paolo Bufalini’s Notebook (1981-1991)</em>in English, is available
               at <a href="https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/bufalini-notebook/" target="_blank">https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/bufalini-notebook/</a>. It is identified by
               ISBN:9788854970793 and DOI: 10.6092/unibo/amsacta/6415. The initial project was
               designed by Francesca Tomasi, Marilena Daquino, and Francesca Giovannetti in the
               academic environment of the Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna. For the last
               version, the team has won a new member, Martina Dello Buono. Francesca Tomasi<span class="note">[See https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/francesca.tomasi/en.]</span> is an
               associate professor in Archival and Library Science at the University of Bologna and
               Director of the International Second Cycle in Digital Humanities and Digital
               Knowledge (DHDK). She is the supervisor of PBN. Marilena Daquino<span class="note">[See https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/marilena.daquino2/en.]</span>, a research
               assistant at the Alma Mater, has been a specialist in metadata at the Multimedia
               Centre at the University of Bologna. In this project, she covered the role of RDF
               modeling and development expert. The third curator of the project is Francesca
                  Giovannetti<span class="note">[See https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/francesc.giovannett6/en.]</span>, doctoral
               student and teaching tutor at the Department of Classical and Italian Philology of
               the University of Bologna (FICLIT), who has made Paolo Bufalini’s notebook her study
               example for both bachelor (<a href="#giovannetti2013" target="_blank">Giovannetti

<p>After Bufalini’s death, his sons donated his personal notebook (kept from
               1981 to 1991) to FICLIT, where some scholars brought the complex textual dynamics
               that animated the paper to light (see <a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">Citti
                  2008</a>, 2). This philological work has been conveyed to the digital edition in
               question, first published in 2019, updated in April 2020, and then again in January
               2021 (current version). Thus, the present review is based on this latter version of
               PBN, but the first draft had as a reference the edition of April 2020. That explains
               why, in the following pages, you will run into some screenshots and images that I
               took from the previous version and that are not retrievable anymore but useful to
               enhance the improvements achieved by the current edition. Today, the original
               manuscript is treasured in Ezio Raimondi Library in Bologna.</p>
<p>During the decade 1981–1991 (<a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">Citti 2008</a>, 2), Paolo Bufalini kept a private journal, which is the
               expression of an experienced man’s thoughts with a sophisticated intellectual
               tension, who had never stopped studying and expanding his knowledge. The Latin
               classics (including Catullus, Lucretius, Horace, Virgil, etc.), the major figures of
               the Italian literature (Dante, Manzoni, Carducci, Croce, etc.), and the protagonists
               of foreign cultures (Flaubert, Shakespeare, Mann, Tolstoy, etc.) came together on the
               same sheet of paper, inside a unique stream of thought. The notebook contains notes
               in Italian, Latin, and English, with the margins and footer filled with annotations.
               As a result, following the author’s thought process can be difficult at times.</p>
<p>Cardinal Silvestrini (1923–2019), who met Bufalini for the revision of
               the Concordat (1984), remembers Bufalini and his notebook with these words:
                  C’è un quadernetto di scritti di sua mano, appunti del decennio ’81-’91 che
                     la figlia Jolanda mi ha gentilmente mostrato. È una specie di “calepino”
                     morale, in cui egli raccoglie i pensieri di autori e pensieri suoi, scritti
                     negli intervalli più diversi, durante una pausa di riunioni e assemblee, o
                     durante un viaggio, per esempio a Cuba, momenti estravaganti di una riflessione
                     in cui l’animo si rifugiava e si placava.A translation of
                        this passage is available in Citti
                           2008, 66: “The Note-book is a kind of moral ‘note-book’, in which
                        he gathers together his own thoughts and those of other writers, written
                        during various moments of his free time, a break in a meeting or assembly or
                        during a journey, to Cuba for example, odd moments of reflection in which
                        his soul took refuge and was calmed.” (Matteoli 2002, 35)</p>
<p>The text shows the personal interest of Bufalini in themes of an
               existential nature, such as death and time, but also in the Christian view of life,
               dealing with topics like pain and faith. At the same time, there are lots of passages
               that show Bufalini’s involvement in politics: democracy, mafia, social commitment,
               and other political themes (<a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">Citti
               2008</a>, 66).</p>

  <h3 class="h5">General parameters of the edition</h3>
<p>The website gives key information to frame the context and workflow of
               this work. This is surely the best improvement compared to the version of 2020, in
               which lots of data were missing, like the mention of the work done by the Institute
                  <em>La Permanenza del Classico</em> (involved in the first design of the
               edition) or info about the editors. As mentioned before in the Introduction, the
               older version is not accessible anymore, but I started reviewing this project when
               the current one was not ready yet, and I kept track of the previous edition via notes
               and screenshots.</p>
<p>The ‘Technical specifications’ section (whose link can be found in the
               footer) enables the user to follow the backstage of the work step by step. He/she can
               grasp the meaning of the adopted methodology, the RDF dataset components, the web
               application development, and the possible filters for semantic queries. The choice to
               include on the website technical information not strictly related to the philological
               value of the edition, like the explanation of web application development, unveils a
               didactic vocation, which goes well with the academic environment where the edition is
               born. Although expanding beyond the humanities to include explanations about
               ontologies, metadata, and web technologies is commendable, the lack of information on
               the philological principles utilized, which deserves its own dedicated section, can
               be perceived as a shortcoming. While it is true that different entities
               (specifically, the study center <em>La Permanenza del Classico</em>) made the
               editorial decisions, it is also true that Francesca Giovannetti, one of the
               publishers of PBN, was involved in the project’s development from an early stage, as
               she confirms in the passage below. 
                  The development of the digital edition started with the diplomatic
                     transcription of the text, which preserved all the original characteristics of
                     the writings, such as spelling and punctuation, deletions and additions,
                     abbreviations and line breaks. Subsequently, the centre carried out the
                     encoding of the text in TEI Lite P4. […] In 2013, the centre [“La Permanenza
                     del Classico”] came to the decision of migrating from TEI Lite P4 to TEI P5 and
                     I was charged with this task. […] With the migration from TEI Lite P4 to TEI P5
                     the encoding model has substantially changed: different choices were made for
                     the representation of textual phenomena and of editorial additions. (Giovannetti 2015, 2)</p>
<p>Furthermore, since PBN is the only open-access available output of the
               editorial and philological work done on the text by both <em>La Permanenza del
                  Classico</em> and the PBN publishers, as detailed in the ‘Subject and Content’
               section, it would be appropriate to provide more comprehensive information about
               these decisions. However, a close comparative reading between the facsimile and the
               transcription allows an informed user to grasp the philological decisions behind the
               text and its transcription because there are no cases of extreme philological
               complexity, no variants, for instance.</p>
<p>Moreover, the financial resources available for the project are not
               clarified, and the timeline is undeclared. On the other hand, as mentioned in the
               below ‘Aim and methods’ paragraph, the goals and the embraced approach are explained.
               The general parameters of the edition, therefore, can be considered partially
               accessible to the final user: the overview of the context, the editors, the mission,
               and methods are accessible, and the philological work is explained in a few sentences
               but not accurately covered.</p>

<section id="div4">
  <h3 class="h5">Subject and content</h3>
<p>The subject of the digital edition is the autograph manuscript of Paolo
               Bufalini’s notebook. The unpublished 143 bound pages and two loose sheets
               (corresponding to pages 144-147 in the <em>facsimile</em>) represent the entire
               research area of the project.</p>
<p>The PBN does not rely on printed editions. The project <em>Quaderni di
                  Paolo Bufalini</em>, curated by the Institute <em>La Permanenza del
                  Classico</em>, could be considered the digital archetype of this current
               edition. As explained on the corresponding webpage<span class="note">[https://centri.unibo.it/permanenza/it/attivita-ed-eventi/quaderni-di-paolo-bufalini.]</span>
               and in more detail in Giovannetti (<a href="#giovannetti2015" target="_blank">2015</a>), the backbone of the editorial project had already been formed in
               2008, when the diplomatic edition was completed, the dense network of references was
               revealed, and the first encoding with the XML/TEI P4 was provided. However, the beta
               version, which was edited by the Institute, cannot be consulted. It is not clear
               whether it is simply not open-source software or if it is not available since the
               release of the current edition. Everything we know about the previous edition’s
               achievements is reported in the research paper by Citti (<a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">2008</a>), where we can also find some archive images (<a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">Citti 2008</a>, 78).</p>
</section>

<section id="div5">
  <h3 class="h5">Aims and methods</h3>
<p>The paper by Daquino, Giovannetti, and Tomasi (<a href="#daquino_giovannetti_tomasi2019" target="_blank">2019</a>), added as a suggested reading
               at the end of the ‘Introduction’ page of PBN, helps to understand the aims of the
               edition better:
                  Molte delle ESD ad oggi disponibili online presentano una struttura
                     documento-centrica. […] Si tratta del paradigma tipico della stampa
                     tipografica, trasportato dall’ambiente analogico a quello digitale.
                     L’espansione del Web of data sollecita la ridefinizione del concetto di ESD da
                     parte della comunità accademica. L’ESD […] deve essere ripensata come insieme
                     di entità, ovvero anche risorse identificate univocamente con URI e
                     interconnesse attraverso l’uso di link tipizzati (le proprietà RDF), secondo un
                     paradigma dato-centrico.Translation by the author: “Many of
                        the EDSs available online today adopt a document-centric structure. [...]
                        This is the typical paradigm of printing, transported from the analogue to
                        the digital environment. The expansion of the Web of data calls for the
                        redefinition of the concept of ESD by the academic community. The ESD [...]
                        has to be rethought as a set of entities, that also means resources uniquely
                        identified with URIs and interconnected through the use of typed links (the
                        RDF properties), according to a data-centric paradigm.” (Daquino,
                        Giovannetti, and Tomasi 2019, 50)</p>
<p>Every working step of the project was conceived with this perspective in
               mind. DSEs can exchange precious knowledge thanks to shared knowledge graphs on the
               Semantic Web. The TEI encoding mediates between the ontologies and the source text,
               and as stated in the ‘XML/TEI Encoding’ section on the PBN ‘Introduction’ page: “It
               aims to represent the relationships between the textual fragments of the notebook
               (citations, comments, translations, etc.) and to link the local authority files to
               external datasets” (<a href="#daquino_dellobuono_giovannetti_tomas2020" target="_blank">Daquino et al. 2020</a>).</p>
<p>This means that the RDF dataset is populated by the extraction of the
               TEI entities via XSLT, generating a Turtle file from the TEI document, or that it is
               created manually (<a href="#giovannetti2015" target="_blank">Giovannetti
                  2015</a>, 30-31). Furthermore, the embedded markup model of the notebook is
               complemented with ontologies that open the door to a ‘global data space’ in which
               URIs identify documents and data they contain (e.g., entities) that could be used in
               many different applications (<a href="#giovannetti2015" target="_blank">Giovannetti 2015</a>, 15). The interoperability of the edition achieved through
               the use of Linked Open Data (LOD) is, therefore, the main scholarly contribution.</p>
<p>The curators, however, have decided to only share the output – the
               result of this ample reflection behind the creation of the edition – through the
               official site of PBN. On the ‘Home’ page you can read: “The primary aims of the
               edition are to identify, analyse and enhance the intratextual and extratextual
               relations – otherwise implicit, given the private nature of the notebook – which
               characterize the texts of the <em>Appunti</em>[...]” (<a href="#daquino_dellobuono_giovannetti_tomas2020" target="_blank">Daquino et al. 2020</a>).</p>
<p>The essence of their research project is to create a bespoke application
               able to enhance the text. They find the answer to such information needs through the
               Semantic Web technologies, but the brief digression on the ‘Introduction’ page about
               the features and the functioning of the LOD implementation could be deepened and
               explained in a more complete way. The risk, otherwise, is that the user, especially
               if new to LOD, could lose the necessary information to enjoy the edition as a whole.
               According to my experience, the paper by Daquino, Giovannetti, and Tomasi (<a href="#daquino_giovannetti_tomasi2019" target="_blank">2019</a>) fills the
               information gap about the strategy to implement the DSE with Semantic Web
               technologies, but I would like to find the explanation of this vision, promoted as
               the strength of the edition in the aforementioned paper, in the official webpage of
               PBN.</p>
<p><em>Paolo Bufalini’s Notebook</em> is classified by the editors, in the Overview
               section of ‘Technical specifications’, as Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition (SSDE),
               but I do not totally agree with them: the ‘Semantic’, ‘Digital’, and ‘Editing’ parts
               are contemplated, but the ‘Scholarly’ only partially covered, because, although the
               transcript is faithful to the text, the philological principles are not stated
               explicitly and in detail.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">User interface</h3>
<p>The design of the site is sober and elegant. There is no discordant note
               that disturbs the layout. The style adopted for the website seems to mirror the
               personality of Paolo Bufalini, an intellectual with a moderate temper, not
               ostentatious, but a man of great depth. The contents of the website are easily
               accessible by using the navigation bar located on the top right of the page.</p>
<p>The navigation bar; screenshot.
               
               
                  
                   Detail of the facsimile; screenshot.
               The navigation bar shows the available sections, highlighting all the
               required information to navigate the website: ‘Home’, ‘Introduction’, ‘Digital
               Edition’, as well as ‘Index of Persons’ and ‘Index of Works’. On the ‘Home’ page, the
               users have access to an overview of what they can find by browsing the website and to
               the links for directly reaching the other main areas of the project. The
               ‘Introduction’, instead, presents the fundamental pillars of the project. The
               ‘Digital edition’ is the area devoted to the visualization of Bufalini’s work,
               whereas the ‘Index of Persons’ and the ‘Index of Works’ are the Semantic indexes,
               which are deepened in the following paragraphs. The website is available in Italian
               and English (the language menu is circled in green in <a href="#img1" target="_blank">Fig. 1</a>). However, it is worth reporting one little error,
               which surely does not compromise the understanding of the text, but it would be
               better to fix it: by accessing the ‘Digital Edition’ section, the box that appears
               when moving the mouse on the facsimile is only partially translated into English
               (detail circled in red, <a href="#img2" target="_blank">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
<p>Example of a bug that appears reducing the screen on PC;
                     screenshot.
               For what concerns the usability of the website, access from devices like
               computers and tablets is granted, but only in a full-screen modality, since the
               exploration of the edition by a reduced screen on a PC distorts the interface, which
               undergoes a loss of information and functions (see <a href="#img3" target="_blank">Fig. 3</a>). The horizontal comparison between the
                  <em>facsimile</em> and the transcript, for example, is totally hampered by the
               graphic arrangement of the ‘Transcript’ box placed vertically above the ‘Facsimile’
               box. Although a medium-sized screen is generally recommended to use a DSE, and
               therefore, the aforementioned situation cannot be properly defined as a deficiency,
               making the site responsive might be a valuable idea to take into account for a
               possible future edition.</p>
<p>There is no area dedicated to listing the bibliographic sources, just a
               suggested reading for a full technical description of the edition at the end of the
               ‘Introduction’ page. Besides, there is a SPARQL endpoint, available through the
               footer, where the user can enter queries and have access to data. Since there is no
               further documentation about how to use it, this section is reserved for those who are
               familiar with this semantic query language. Finally, as the editors claim in the
               ‘Licences’ section (accessible from the footer), the code of the application is
               available under a CC0 license (<a href="#daquino_giovannetti_dellobueno2021" target="_blank">Daquino, Giovannetti, and Dello Bueno
                  2021</a>), the dataset of the notebook is available under a CC BY 4.0 license on
               AMSActa (<a href="#tomasi_daquino_giovannetti2019" target="_blank">Tomasi,

                   Digital Edition window – current edition – screenshot.
               My personal experience as a user of PBN suggests that the edition is
               presented as an easily usable product. The nav buttons, for instance, are easily
               interpretable, and the features provided correspond to the expectations of a digital
               edition’s user: as explained in the previous paragraph, the terminology used for
               buttons and hyperlinks is quite unequivocal. Clicking on the ‘Digital Edition’ button
               in the navigation bar, for instance, one can expect to access the
                  <em>facsimile</em> images of the notebook<span class="note">[The FICLIT Digital Library (https://web.archive.org/web/20231101071744/https://dl.ficlit.unibo.it/s/lib/item/198982)

                  manuscript codex, like details on its format and the color of the cover.]</span>,
               and this is what happens. The user can browse through the <em>facsimile</em>,
               shown in a double-page layout. The resolution of the images (taken with an i2S
               CopiBook planetary scanner)<span class="note">[This detail is omitted on the
                  official PBN page. Look at Citti

               the quality being affected. On the <em>facsimile</em>, the user can discover the
               quotations (and their origin, even if implicit), the annotations, and some life
               memories caught in the calligraphy of the author. The current version (<a href="#img5" target="_blank">Fig. 5</a>) is more complex and richer in filters
               and features than the previous one (available in 2020) (<a href="#img4" target="_blank">Fig. 4</a>).</p>
<p>The user can arrange the window by opening or closing the box of
               ‘Filters’, ‘Transcription’, and ‘Facsimile’. It is a graphical strategy that
               enables the user to stay focused on what he/she is interested in, keeping open the
               possibility to switch modality of consulting the edition. Moreover, the user can set
               the font, the size, and the background color of the transcription box (clicking on
               the TT circled in orange, see <a href="#img5" target="_blank">Fig. 5</a>). This page shows several useful links and
               information: the question mark (‘?’) on the right (circled in light blue, <a href="#img5" target="_blank">Fig. 5</a>) explains all the tools available to
               discover the edition; the ‘Metadata’ (circled in purple, <a href="#img5" target="_blank">Fig. 5</a>), instead, displays a brief table summarising the key
               info about the PBN; the icon of IIIF (circled in pink, <a href="#img5" target="_blank">Fig. 5</a>), which stands for International Image
               Interoperability Framework<span class="note">[International Image Interoperability
                  Framework. https://iiif.io/.]</span>, is linked to the complete facsimile on the
               FICLIT Digital Library; on the left, the symbol of the encoding (circled in blue,
                  <a href="#img5" target="_blank">Fig. 5</a>) allows to download the XML/TEI
               file of the notebook.</p>
<p>Example of “People” filter result; screenshot.
               The ‘Filters’ tab, split into ‘People’ and ‘Works’, is a tool to search for
               specific contents in the transcription. The occurrences of the selected person are
               reported in a list of results on top, and they are highlighted in blue in the
               transcription of the notebook. Once a ‘People’ filter is adopted, you can also
               distinguish the results by the ‘Person role’ (‘Author’ or ‘Mentioned person’), as
                  <a href="#img6" target="_blank">Fig. 6</a> shows.</p>
<p>Concerning the text fruition, when the mouse cursor scrolls on a
               paragraph of a page in the facsimile, a frameset containing some information about
               that text portion (like the author of the quoted text, mentioned entities,
               translations, etc.) shows up on the screen (red circle, <a href="#img6" target="_blank">Fig. 6</a>), whereas, clicking on it, the transcript of that
               portion appears on the left. The facsimile and the transcription box, indeed, are
               synchronized: when the user turns over the pages, the transcription automatically
               updates to reach the textual passage the facsimile is showing. Vice versa, by
               scrolling up or down on the transcription tab (that offers a sequential read,
               developed vertically), the facsimile quickly goes on or back to the point considered.</p>
<p>This elegant format makes the reading fluid and pleasant. The user does
               not run into the discomfort of having to open other screens to fully enjoy the text
               and its meaning. However, the page layout loses this harmony when you disable the
               full-screen mode of the browser window.</p>
<p>Index of Persons window; screenshot.
               The PBN also presents two indices, e.g., the ‘Index of Persons’ and the
               ‘Index of Works’, related to people and works mentioned by Bufalini on his pages. The
               indices are well organized. The user can directly search among ‘People’ and ‘Works’
               thanks to the search bar (circled in red, <a href="#img7" target="_blank">Fig.
                  7</a>) or by browsing the list. A legend (on the bottom left, circled in green,
                  <a href="#img7" target="_blank">Fig. 7</a>) clarifies the different colors
               assigned to ‘Comments’, ‘Quotations’, and ‘Translations’. The possibility of
               arranging the page is appreciable, as I explained before, but in this case, the
               ‘Filters’ tab is unnecessary because it plays the same role as the ‘List’ of names.
               Besides, even if the user decides to close this box, the ‘Types of excerpts’ (the
               legend) would be closed consequently.</p>

                     screenshot.
               Furthermore, each author, listed alphabetically, is linked to authority
               files from VIAF and the Italian DBpedia where available, which disambiguate the
               identity of the person. In the same manner, each work is connected to external
               sources, VIAF and WorldCat, two identification systems that grant authoritativeness
               to the information shared by the digital edition. The links to DBpedia, however, are
               incorrect and, therefore, do not link to the correct page (<a href="#img8" target="_blank">Fig. 8</a>). The server <em>it.dbpedia.org</em> does not
               exist. The correct one is <em>www.dbpedia.org.</em>
               <span class="note">[Therefore, to have the identifier of Vittorio Alfieri, for
                  example, the link should be https://dbpedia.org/page/VittorioAlfieri and not

               like the links to Louise Colet’s and Gabriel Malagrida’s pages. (<a href="#img9" target="_blank">Fig. 9</a>)</p>

                     explanation of the suggested steps to interact with it by VoiceOver;
                     screenshot.
               According to Jacob Nielsen, father of the ten usability heuristics, for a
               product like a website to be considered ‘usable’, it should possess the following
               five properties: it should have an easy-to-learn structure; be efficient to use; be
               easy to remember, meaning that the user can easily regain proficiency when returning
               to the site after a period of time; the site should always give the user the
               possibility to fix an error and, finally, its design should be pleasant to use (<a href="#nielsen2012" target="_blank">Nielsen 2012</a>). As I stated in the
               previous section, my personal experience as a user of PBN was a positive one, and the
               edition seemed to me to comply the aforementioned five points. However, I may not
               represent the end user, who could be visually impaired or blind. Thus, I checked if
               the edition met the required accessibility parameters to allow everyone to use the
               website, disabled people included, and the result was quite satisfying. A screen
                  reader<span class="note">[I used VoiceOver by Apple. An explanation about how it

               a high value (circled in green, <a href="#img11" target="_blank">Fig. 11</a>),
               whereas, in the other points, where the text has a colored background (circled in

               intense color, this value increases (circled in green, <a href="#img13" target="_blank">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

               Nevertheless, in the accessibility of PNB, there is a kink: in the HTML
               code, there are no ALT attributes to describe the images of the site, but this flaw
               is reduced by the fact that there are few meaningful images, which deserve this care,
               most of them are decorative images. However, this implies, for instance, that in the
               ‘Digital Edition’ area, the blind user can listen to the transcription and browse the
               page of the notebook (because of the correct access to the navigation button) without
               knowing that the webpage is showing the notebook facsimile (<a href="#img14" target="_blank">Fig. 14</a>) since there is no alternative ALT description,
               which could indicate this information.</p>
<p>Except for this lack, the edition meets the accessibility requirements
               for users with disabilities.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Text criticism</h3>
<p>Even though PBN does not devote a deep explanation to the editing
               principles, it is clear that the transcription made by the editors comes close to a
               diplomatic one. Francesco Citti writes: “all characteristics concerning spelling and
               punctuation, including any eventual errors or incorrect quotations were preserved.
               Particular marks (such as arrows, references, boxes), were reproduced and where this
               was not possible, were described (using notes […]” (<a href="citti2008" target="_blank">Citti</a>, 71). Indeed, the transcription philologically reproduces the
               original text, trying to maintain unaltered any passage, but in the digital edition,
               not all the symbols and signs are reproduced in the same way compared to what is
               visible in the facsimile. Some examples are given below.</p>
<p>Memory of Luigi Petroselli, facsimile, page 7;
                     screenshot.
               In <a href="#img15" target="_blank">Fig. 15</a>, there is a notable
               passage of the notebook. It is a personal comment of Bufalini, who remembers the
               impressions and emotions felt during the funeral of his friend Luigi Petroselli on
               8th October 1981.</p>
<p>The handwriting thins out; it follows the stream of the thoughts and,
               therefore, runs from the hand to the sheet, the line spacing gets smaller, and the
               time of the story is agitated. It has been written in one go. The erasures and second
               thoughts, indeed, have been purposefully kept by the author. The interpretation of
               the passage is undoubtedly difficult because of the unclear handwriting; however, the
               transcription proposed by the PBN wisely reveals the sense of those words.</p>
<p>The transcript of the notebook is, therefore, sophisticated, but, as I
               wrote above, there is no documentation of the editing principles. In the
               ‘Philological note’ of the ‘Introduction’ page, we can read:
                  The transcription philologically reproduces the original text. However, in
                     the digital edition we did not reproduce the exact symbols and signs used by
                     the author to separate or graphically connect excerpts. Nonetheless, along with
                     the transcription, the edition offers an interactive visualization of
                     facsimiles, so that the reader can retrieve all the details. (Daquino
                        et al. 2020)</p>
<p>A further clarification about the philological principles is, instead,
               available in the section <em>Digital edition: representation and encoding of the
                  ‘Note-book’</em> of one of the main bibliographic references (<a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">Citti 2008</a>, 71-77). The philological
               principles are indeed enclosed in the XML encoding, which expresses the
               interpretation of text fragments curated by the study center <em>La Permanenza del
                  Classico</em>. For instance, a markup such as <div2 type="nota"
                  place="margine"> is assigned to a margin note of the notebook, and
                  <hi rend="sottolineato"> is assigned to a graphic element of
               the underlining (<a href="#citti2008" target="_blank">Citti 2008</a>, 77). The
               transcription of graphical elements is quite intuitive because of their high
               resemblance with the symbols of the original pages. However, the absence of a legend
               of identified marks with the corresponding meaning is not admissible for a scholarly
               edition. Especially if, like in the example below (<a href="#img18" target="_blank">Fig. 18</a> and <a href="#img19" target="_blank">19</a>),
               there is not an evident rule applicable everywhere.</p>
<p>The following is a brief list of symbols that I detected during my study
               of the edition:
                  ▬: erasures of unrecognizable words (e.g., pp. 1, 6, 60)
                  
                     deleted: erasure of recognizable words
                  
                     insertion/insertion: insertions of a word below and above the line (e.g., pp.
                     60, 62, 135)
                  
                     underlining: lines traced by Bufalini
                  ⧟: reproduces the equivalent sign designed by Bufalini in some pages
                     (e.g., pp. 24-25). It is a sort of intratextual reference.</p>
<p>Transcription and facsimile of pages 24-25;
                     screenshot.
               
               
                  
                   A detail of the facsimile, page 25; screenshot.
               The following example (<a href="#img16" target="_blank">Fig. 16</a>)
               shows both the black rectangle ▬ and the two connected circles ⧟. The
               first one, however, could be replaced by another symbol because the word deleted by
               the author is recognizable. Under the erasures, ‘Nitzsche’ can be seen (circled in
               red in <a href="#img16" target="_blank">Fig. 16</a> and zoomed in <a href="#img17" target="_blank">Fig. 17</a>). Thus, ‘Nitzsche’ could
               be a better solution. Moreover, even if the symbol ⧟ is retraced by Bufalini
               with a red pen both times (p. 24 and p. 25), the editors reproduce it in red only the
               second time (circled in blue and orange, <a href="#img16" target="_blank">Fig.
                  16</a>). This choice seems to be motivated by a graphical reference to
               interconnect two passages of the notebook.</p>
<p>The facsimile of page 54; screenshot.
               By a cross-check, I noted that all discrepancies that emerged between the
               full transcription and the <em>facsimile</em> in the previous version of PBN
               (like omitted square brackets) were fixed. Only one symbol is missing from the
               transcription (<a href="#img18" target="_blank">Fig. 18</a>). It is quite
               common in the notebook, and it seems an inversion of words, but maybe it is not
               univocally interpreted by the editors.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Data modelling and ontologies</h3>
<p>The encoded transcription follows the TEI standard. In 2013, the center
                  <em>La Permanenza del Classico</em> decided to migrate from TEI Lite P4 to TEI
               P5, and Francesca Giovannetti was charged with this task (<a href="#giovannetti2015" target="_blank">Giovannetti 2015</a>). 
                  The new encoding structures the notebook into logical units that follow the
                     physical pages. Each page is enclosed within a <div> element
                     and the beginning of each page is marked by the elements
                        <pb> and <milestone>, which
                     respectively carry a @n attribute expressing the page number as
                     assigned by the scribe and a @unit attribute to explicit which
                     side of folio the page corresponds to (the value is either ‘recto’ or ‘verso’).
                     Each page is further divided into subsections marked up as
                        <div>, each of which contains a fragment of text. Three
                     types of fragments have been identified: quotation, comment and translation.
                     These are distinguished by the value of the attribute @type (e.g.
                        <div type="quotation">). The relationships between
                     fragments are established using the attributes @corresp or
                        @ref. (Giovannetti 2015, 2-3)</p>
<p>Part of the XML code, from line 2213 to 2243;
                     screenshot.
               
               <a href="#img19" target="_blank">Fig. 19</a> provides you with an example to
               show you some of the features that Giovannetti explained above.</p>
<p>The XML/TEI file is downloadable on the ‘Digital Edition’ page, by
               clicking on the encoding symbol in the transcription tab. Nonetheless, it could be
               beneficial to provide users with an extra way of accessing the code through the
               ‘Home’ or ‘Introduction’ pages and possibly linking it to the ‘XML/TEI Encoding’
               paragraph to make it more easily discoverable.</p>
<p>‘The Metamodel’ and ‘The Knowledge Graph’ paragraphs on the
               ‘Introduction’ page explain that in the PBN, the traditional hierarchical markup and
               the semantic representation of data coexist. The conversion of the XML/TEI code to
               RDF (Resource Description Framework), conceived by the World Wide Web Consortium
               (W3C), results in the creation of a main knowledge graph<span class="note">[http://projects.dharc.unibo.it/bufalini-notebook/resource/edition/.]</span>
               of 8K triples and other separated graphs (about 800 triples). The curators follow the
               nanopublication approach, according to which each group of RDF statements is
               accompanied by three additional graphs containing information about the assertions'
               provenance, the digital scholarly edition, and the nanopublication itself. The three
               graphs are interconnected, with one graph describing the nanopublication and linking
               the other three graphs.</p>
<p>The project team opted to reuse ontologies from Linked Open Vocabularies
                  (LOV)<span class="note">[Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV). https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov.]</span> to shape the information
               held by the notebook. The choice of reusing existing ontologies rather than creating
               new ones is an appreciable effort to enable and enhance the cooperability between
               researchers who can rely on this model. The representation of the main graph was
               designed with the Open Annotation model. The SPAR Ontologies FaBiO<span class="note">[FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology. https://sparontologies.github.io/fabio/current/fabio.html.]</span> and
                  CiTO<span class="note">[CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology. https://sparontologies.github.io/cito/current/cito.html.]</span> are used
               for describing bibliographic resources and citations. Indeed, through the pages of
               his notebook, in search of confirmation for his intuitions, Bufalini records the
               words of authors and philosophers who support his beliefs. CiTO is particularly
               suited for reproducing these circumstances. As stated in the ‘Introduction’ page,
               about 800 RDF triples, which make up 10% of the knowledge base, represent Bufalini's
               notions regarding the relationships between the texts and authors in the notebook. To
               capture these ideas, HiCO, an ontology that expands on PROV-O and enables the
               specification of a statement's source, is employed.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Long term use</h3>
<p>PBN’s description in “DH.arc projects” page;
                     screenshot.
               The official PBN website does not provide any updates on the long-term
               viability of the SDE. Consequently, it is unclear whether the edition is considered
               complete or if the project's editors are still making modifications. Although the PBN
               is listed under the ‘DH.arc projects’<span class="note">[Projects at /DH.arc. https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en/research/projects-at-dh-arc.]</span>,
               linked in the footer section of the ‘Home’ page, with a description indicating
               ‘Release: 2018 (next release 2020)’ and ‘Status: Ongoing’, this information appears
               to be outdated since the last release was in 2020 (<a href="#img20" target="_blank">Fig. 20</a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, the PBN GitHub repository<span class="note">[Daquino,
                     Giovannetti, and Dello Buono 2021.]</span> shows that the last update was
               made precisely two years ago. It is uncertain whether there is institutional support
               to ensure the edition's long-term sustainability and provide lasting access.
               Therefore, it would be beneficial to inform users of the edition about these
               details.</p>

<section id="div12">
  <h3 class="h5">Conclusion</h3>
<p>PBN fulfils some of the main requirements that a Scholarly Digital
               Edition should meet: it offers a critical representation of the historical document
               that is Paolo Bufalini’s notebook and it is guided by a digital paradigm. However, it
               lacks a deep philological documentation. Indeed, a potential printed version of this
               edition would lose contents and functionalities detained by the current one. The user
               is invited to interact with the system and to consult its metadata, to access
               reliable sources and a correct transcription, and its editors have the merit of
               sharing a high-value work previously unpublished. Besides, the work done for
               extending the reality of the edition to the Semantic Web environment is what makes
               this digital edition innovative and different from the others available nowadays.
               According to Patrick Sahle’s catalog of Digital Scholarly Edition<span class="note">[Sahle 2008-2023.]</span>, indeed,
               among more than 700 cases of studies, only one makes use of Semantic Web
               technologies, and it is burckhardtsource project<span class="note">[burckhardtsource
                  project. https://burckhardtsource.org/.]</span>, a semantic Digital Library that
               hosts the critical and semantic edition of the letters written to Jacob
               Burckhardt.</p>
<p>The decisions that have guided PBN are described, but the lack of
               detailed documentation of the project represents a flaw. Conveying all the
               information about the project (currently spread into different scholarly
                  articles<span class="note">[Citti 2008 and Daquino, Giovannetti, and Tomasi
                     2019.]</span>, mainly written by the same editors) on the PBN page would
               make it a self-sufficient source.</p>
<p>Moreover, the notebook also appears very suitable for a critical edition
               with a critical commentary. Thanks to the dates noted by Bufalini at the top of some
               pages, it could be interesting to investigate some possible connections between his
               philosophical reflections and the coeval social and historical context, during which,
               let me stress, Bufalini still served as senator of the Republic. This is just an idea
               that genuinely came to me while leafing through the notebook. Alternatively, another
               suggestion could be to conduct a technical analysis of the various pens<span class="note">[Bufalini used black, blue, red, and even green pens. He sometimes
                  took a pencil to underline pieces of text written with the pen. Page 140 of the
                  notebook shows this mixture well.]</span> used by the author over ten years, which
               could unveil, for instance, the timing and the meaning of some comments and the
               underlining. So why not think about extending the ambitions and aims of the edition
               to a wider work in the future?</p>
<p>Therefore, PBN is a valuable project that achieves a good result in
               terms of visualization of the facsimile, accessibility, and usability; it has a
               modern style that makes the fruition of the site an enjoyable experience and provides
               a well-done transcription of an unpublished work. In conclusion, although the editors
               did not mention further extensions of the edition, I would suggest they deal with
               some of the weaknesses of the edition and fully realize the high potential of
               PBN.</p>
