          <p>Consistency and coherence in annotated and enriched data are vital to the success of
               any digital edition project. Custom frameworks within the oXygen XML Editor provide a
               user-friendly approach for editors to interact directly with XML data, thus lowering
               entry barriers and ensuring consistency across datasets. Drawing on our experiences as customisers, this review explores the benefits and
               limitations of these custom frameworks, highlighting their potential for
               interdisciplinary teams with varying levels of XML expertise. We critically examine
               the technical requirements for creating and maintaining custom frameworks, as well as
               the current state of documentation. We also discuss challenges that users may face
               with oXygen’s complex interface. Once implemented, frameworks facilitate uniform data
               input, allow for the automation of repetitive annotation tasks, and integrate
               seamlessly with project workflows, thereby enabling users to focus on annotation
               tasks in an environment tailored to the specific needs of each project. In our 
               opinion, despite being underutilised and insufficiently promoted within the
               oXygen platform, custom frameworks offer extensive functionalities that meet the
               needs of a wide variety of edition projects.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Introduction</h3>
<p>Consistency and coherence of annotated and enriched data are crucial for
               successful edition projects. To extract necessary information from the data, it must
               be encoded in accordance with established standards. However, when dealing with large
               amounts of data, this can be a challenging task, particularly when an
               interdisciplinary project team with varying levels of editorial and XML expertise is
               involved. In some cases, ensuring uniformity and consistency of data can pose a
               significant challenge in a project.</p>
<p>This review examines a very powerful, yet regrettably ‘hidden tool’ in
               the oXygen XML Editor (see <a href="#syncro2024m" target="_blank">SyncRo Soft
                  2002–2024m</a>): custom oXygen frameworks. First, we will provide a brief
               overview of the tool’s advantages and disadvantages. Then the technical aspects,
               particularly the installation process, necessary conceptual steps and the tool’s GUI,
               documentation, and learnability will be discussed, including an overview of relevant
               functionalities and the relevant terminology. Finally, we summarise the tool’s
               strengths and weaknesses and evaluate its usefulness for digital edition
               projects.</p>

<section id="div3">
  <h3 class="h5">Identification of the Tool</h3>
<p>Custom oXygen frameworks (hereafter referred to as
               <em>framework</em>) are an integrated feature of the oXygen XML Editor (hereafter
               referred to as <em>oXygen</em>). The proprietary editor, which has been
               continuously developed and maintained by SyncRo Soft SRL since 2002, specialises in
               XML-heavy authoring, developing and annotating tasks. It is widely used not only in
               the private sector (see <a href="#syncro2024g" target="_blank">ibid.
                  2002–2024g</a>), but also in the Digital Humanities community. Due to the
               proprietary nature of oXygen (see <a href="#syncro2024g" target="_blank">ibid.</a>), the creation and especially the use of frameworks is only possible
               once the software has been purchased by all users, meaning that functionality depends
               on possessing a valid oXygen software license<span class="note">[While the licenses
                  for the private sector are rather expensive, SyncRo Soft SRL accommodates the
                  academic sector with relatively inexpensive academic licenses (see SyncRo Soft SRL
               2002–2024l).]</span>.</p>
<p>There are two types of frameworks integrated into oXygen: predefined
               frameworks for various XML specifications (e.g. TEI<span class="note">[For more
                  information on the TEI Standard, see TEI
                     Consortium n.d.]</span> or DITA<span class="note">[For more information
                  on the DITA Standard, see OASIS Open
                     2018.]</span>), and custom frameworks, which are created from scratch for
               specific requirements. The integration of the custom frameworks option can be traced back at least to version 13.2 of oXygen, published in 2012.
               Since then, the functionality has continuously evolved, with the latest
               changes introduced in Version 25.1 in 2023 (see <a href="#syncro2023" target="_blank">SyncRo Soft SRL 2023</a>).</p>
<p>This review concentrates on the second type – the option to construct
               frameworks from scratch. It assesses the effort required from the perspective of a
               user-developer (hereafter <em>customiser</em>). However, to comprehensively
               address this, it is essential to also evaluate the tool’s output – the crafted
               framework – as perceived by the <em>user</em><span class="note">[To avoid
                  confusion, the term ‘user’ will be employed when discussing the person engaged in
                  the editing process, as distinct from the term ‘editor’, which refers to the
                  oXygen XML Editor programme.]</span>. The review will use the term
                  <em>tool</em> to refer to the features for creating a framework, while also
               considering the created framework as a tool to facilitate XML annotation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to note, that working with oXygen frameworks
               not automatically means working with ediarum (see <a href="#telota2024a" target="_blank">Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, and
                  TELOTA - IT/DH 2024a</a>; <a href="#dumontetal2021" target="_blank">Dumont
                  et al. 2021</a>). Ediarum is an environment that enables collaborative working
               and publishing of edition projects. The environment consists of multiple software
               components, one of which specifically utilises the framework tool of oXygen and
               expands it by adding additional functionalities. It also incorporates a database
                  (eXist-db<span class="note">[For more information on eXist-db, see eXist Solutions 2018.]</span>) which,
               when set up on a server, enables collaborative working on and publishing of edition
               projects. Alternatively, it is possible to include the ediarum.jar in an existing
               framework to add additional java operations. (<a href="#telota2024b" target="_blank">Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, and
                  TELOTA - IT/DH 2024b</a>; <a href="#telota2024b" target="_blank">ibid.
                  2024c</a>; <a href="#fechner2023" target="_blank">Fechner 2023</a>)</p>
<p>So, while ediarum can be broadly described as a large-scale working
               environment, frameworks are a feature in the oXygen editor itself. Therefore, oXygen
               frameworks are not the same as ediarum, but ediarum utilises the oXygen framework
               functionality and incorporates it into its working environment. Since creating custom
               oXygen frameworks is entirely sufficient for our project work, our review will focus
               specifically on this aspect: the creation and usefulness of custom oXygen frameworks
               for edition projects.<span class="note">[A detailed review of ediarum can be found
                  in RIDE Issue 11 (see Mertgens
                     2019), for anyone interested in a working and publishing environment for
                  their project.]</span></p>

  <h3 class="h5">Creating a Framework</h3>
<p>This section focuses on the process of creating a framework and
               highlights its most important components. This includes technical and conceptual
               prerequisites, an evaluation of the tool’s graphical user interface (GUI) and
               documentation, and examples showcasing core features and functionalities.</p>

<section id="div6">
  <h3 class="h5">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Custom oXygen frameworks are a powerful tool to enable users with little
               or no knowledge of XML to engage directly with XML files, thereby lowering the
               barrier for non-technical personnel to work in digital edition projects. Creating and maintaining frameworks requires a certain level of
               technical knowledge from the customiser, including proficiency in CSS, schema
               languages, XPath, and XSL. For users of a framework, a significant challenge may
               arise from the complexity of the oXygen XML Editor itself, as it can initially feel
               overwhelming with its numerous features and functionalities. However, once the hurdle
               of setting up and familiarising oneself with oXygen are overcome, the benefits of
               using frameworks in projects become clear. They significantly reduce the need for
               specialised technical and digital annotation knowledge by visually replicating
               familiar systems (e.g., designing the framework as a form or making it resemble known
               text editors like Word). This allows users to focus on their annotation work in a
               familiar environment while producing high-quality data.</p>
<p>Frameworks integrate well into existing project workflows and processes,
               as diverse techniques and project materials can be seamlessly and flexibly combined
               to create a comprehensive working environment that encompasses content creation,
               validation, and documentation. Data quality is reliably ensured, as the data inserted
               through the framework is uniform, and illegitimate or missing content can be
               highlighted and easily spotted by users. The built-in actions and functions meet the
               majority of editing requirements and can even be expanded and customised when
               necessary.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the custom frameworks tool is not prominently featured in
               the oXygen environment, and its potential is not effectively communicated. A more
               user-friendly documentation and more real-world examples from other users and
               customisers would significantly improve visibility and accessibility.</p>
<p>While the term ‘framework’ is often used interchangeably with ‘ediarum’,
               it is crucial to recognise that they are not synonymous. Ediarum is a large-scale
               working environment that relies on oXygen frameworks, whereas using the oXygen custom
               framework tool directly to create project specific frameworks is a highly effective
               and less technically demanding solution. The broad range of functionalities and
               options available cover all of our projects’ use cases. Even knowing or using only a
               basic set of the tool’s features, some of which were explored in this paper, is still
               sufficient to meet the tailored needs of most edition projects.</p>
<p>To conclude, in our project experience, both the customisers and the
               users consider oXygen frameworks to be an effective, recommendable tool that
               significantly improves the editing workflow.</p>
