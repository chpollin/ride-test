          <h3><a href="issue18/bufalini.html">Paolo Bufalini’s Notebook</a></h3>
          <div><p>Paolo Bufalini’s Notebook (from here on PBN) is a critical edition of
               the personal notebook that the Italian politician and intellectual Paolo Bufalini
               held from 1981 to 1991. The edition offers the opportunity to plunge into the flow of
               thoughts of a man of the twentieth century who reflects on philosophy, poetry, and
               politics. The methodical goal of this edition, which is implemented with XML/TEI and
               RDF graphs, is to create an encoding system using Semantic Web technologies, able to
               emphasize the complex network of quotations and annotations that fills the pages. The
               digital edition aims to follow a data-centric paradigm. In this light, PBN is
               connected to authority files and external knowledge bases, such as DBpedia, VIAF, and
               WorldCat, to harness the power of the Linked Open Data universe. This review provides
               the reader with an overview of Paolo Bufalini’s work and the main features of the
               semantic critical edition. Finally, PBN can be evaluated as a decent edition, which
               responds to certain requirements of a digital edition, but not to all, and it still
               lends itself to improvements and new developments.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue18/catullus.html">Catullus Online</a></h3>
          <div><p>Catullus Online, a collection of the author’s poems and a repository of
               the conjectures collected through the centuries, was published by Dániel Kiss with
               the support of the Abteilung für Griechische und Lateinische Philologie
               of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, in 2013. Kiss faced many difficulties
               in the creation of such a resource, both from a technical standpoint and from the
               inner complexity of the philological tradition behind Catullus and his poems. He
               still ended up creating a rather interesting Scholarly Digital Edition, which has
               made such work more accessible, even to those that don’t typically belong in the
               academic world, offering the possibility to access high-quality photos of the
               manuscripts, a curated apparatus and much other information about the texts and the
               author, with just a simple click. What is mostly missing in this project is a more
               sophisticated digital interface, a lost opportunity to further enhance the quality of
               such a Scholarly Digital Edition.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue18/furnace-fugue.html">Furnace and Fugue. A multimedia edition of Michael Maier’s Atalanta
               fugiens</a></h3>
          <div><p>Furnace and Fugue is a digital edition of Michael Maier’s (1568-1622)
                  opus magnum, the emblem book Atalanta fugiens (1617/18)
               in which Latin and German texts are paired with images and musical fugues in an
               enigmatic way to engage users of the book in deep meditation on alchemical subjects.
               The digital edition of the text itself, including an English translation based on a
               17th century manuscript, is accompanied by a number of scholarly essays. A main
               feature is the MEI player, which includes a piano roll visualisation that allows
               users to experience the musicological makeup of Atalanta fugiens even
               without a background in music theory. The edition is a beautifully designed “haute
               couture” edition, intended to provide an example for the future of digital scholarly
               publishing. The project has used digital editing effectively to enable the multimedia
               experience that Michael Maier had likely envisioned for Atalanta
                  fugiens. but which was previously inaccessible to most users of the
               book.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue18/spaengler.html">A synergistic approach to non-narrative historical sources. The database and
               digital edition of the Spängler household account books, 1733–1785</a></h3>
          <div><p>The household account books of the Salzburg merchant family Spängler cover an
               exceptionally long period and constitute a unique source for the history of
               consumption in Central Europe in the eighteenth century. This review assesses the
               diplomatic and database edition that was published by the University of Salzburg and
               partners in 2020. The review focuses on the synergies that the scholarly digital
               edition of the household account books aims to establish between the transcription of
               the books, a database for querying their contents, and a special section containing
               biographical entries about the actors registered in the books. The review shows where
               this combination of editing styles is fruitful, especially for non-narrative sources,
               and where there is scope for further improvements.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue18/sturm.html">DER STURM</a></h3>
          <div><p>This paper reviews the digital edition Der Sturm – Digitale Quellenedition zur
                  Geschichte der internationalen Avantgarde, which aims to bring together all
               existing digital sources on the STURM company, to make them accessible and to link
               them with each other. Initiated by Herwarth Walden by founding the STURM magazine for
               contemporary art, the STURM company provided many different platforms (e.g., gallery,
               publishing, theatre) for the art scene in Germany at the beginning of the 20th
               century and had also a big impact on the international avant-garde. The digital
               edition currently offers facsimiles, transcriptions, and commentaries on a part of
               the letters, the encoding of the sources and texts is done in TEI-XML and can be
               downloaded or accessed via an API. Inventory lists exist for the other documents
               which link to the source of the digital image. All semantic and structural entities
               of STURM sources are permanently referenced using persistent identifiers.</p>
