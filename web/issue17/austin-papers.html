          <p>The digital edition Digital Austin Papers (DAP) collects the
               correspondence of Stephen F. Austin and a selection of key associates from the 1820s
               and 1830s. It provides valuable insight into the changes occurring in the Texas
               borderlands during the early 19th century, both politically and socially. DAP offers
               full-text views of the collection of letters and two methods to download their
               TEI/XML files. Great emphasis is placed on browsing and search functionalities,
               striving to test new ways to discover patterns within the dataset. Its incorporation
               of sentiment analysis is one of DAP’s more unique characteristics. DAP has great
               potential but requires some additional data processing (e.g. assigning authority file
               IDs) to achieve it.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Introduction</h3>
<p>The subject of this review is the digital edition <em>Digital Austin
                  Papers</em> (DAP), developed at the Department of History, College of Liberal
               Arts & Social Sciences at the University of North Texas<span class="note">[See https://web.archive.org/web/20230312094827/https://history.unt.edu/.]</span> and The Portal to Texas History<span class="note">[See https://web.archive.org/web/20230311192516/https://texashistory.unt.edu/.]</span>. The edition invites its users to “discover the Texas borderlands through the
               eyes of Stephen F. Austin” (<a href="#austin2016b" target="_blank">Digital Austin
                  Papers 2016b</a>), the “Father of Texas”. Specific focus is placed on the
               turbulent times of the 1820s and 1830s.</p>
<p>The early 19th century “constitutes a significant chapter in demographic
               expansion of English speakers into Spanish and Mexican territory” (<a href="#cummins2019" target="_blank">Cummins 2019</a>, 172). Settlement
               interactions between Anglo and Spanish parties began during the era of the American
               Revolution with the arrival of the first Anglo-Americans in the Mississippi Valley.
               The situation reached its “final chapter” with the arrival of Anglo-Americans in
               Spanish Texas during the 1820s (<a href="#cummins2019" target="_blank">Cummins
                  2019</a>, 172–173). As a prominent land agent, Austin was in a unique position,
               working closely with all three parties.</p>
<p>On the 17th of January 1821, Moses Austin (Stephen F. Austin’s father)
               acquired permission to settle 300 families in Spanish Texas. Upon his father’s death
               in the summer of 1821, Austin took over his family’s venture. Through skilful and
               diplomatic negotiations, Austin was able to renew the official grant, and so the
               legal settlement of Anglo-Americans in Spanish (later Mexican) Texas commenced (<a href="#taylor2015" target="_blank">Taylor 2015</a>). Austin’s efforts were
               successful. Over the next few years, he acquired three further grants to settle 900
               more families in the colony (<a href="#texaslibrary2017" target="_blank">Texas
                  State Library and Archives Commission</a>). During the 1820s and 1830s, Austin
               became “the most prominent land agent working with the government of Mexico to bring
               colonists from the United States into the Texas borderlands” <a href="#austin2016a" target="_blank">(Digital Austin Papers 2016a</a>). Austin's significance
               to the region during this period is also reflected in the naming of the modern-day
               capital of Texas as “Austin” (<a href="#humphrey2023" target="_blank">Humphrey
                  2023</a>).</p>
<p>The numerous and well-preserved correspondence of Stephen F. Austin
               provides a deep insight into the historical circumstances in and around Texas in the
               1820s and 1830s, particularly within the social, political, and cultural fields. The
               corpus documents the climate and events affected by the shifting border boundaries of
               the time. It is an invaluable resource for researchers of the border regions,
               available and searchable in the digital edition, DAP, since 2016.</p>
<p>DAP mainly presents Austin‘s correspondence, although it also includes
               relevant correspondences belonging to family members and key associates. The content
               of the digital edition builds on Eugene C. Barker’s printed edition of the Austin
                  Papers.<span class="note">[Barker’s edition appeared in three volumes.
                  It is fully digitised and accessible online: https://web.archive.org/web/20231211095701/https:/texashistory.unt.edu/search/?fq=str_title_serial:%22The%20Austin%20Papers%22.]</span>
               DAP aims to make the Austin correspondences available in digital form and to
               experiment with and provide new exploratory methods for discovering patterns within
               the corpus. One explorative method that makes DAP unique and sets it apart from its
               printed counterpart is the incorporation of sentiment analysis. Overall, the digital
               edition’s range of browsing options is arguably its biggest asset.</p>
<p>The editorial staff of the project consists of Andrew Torget and Debbie
               Liles. Ben W. Brumfield, Jason Ellis, Sara Carlstead Brumfield, William Hicks,
               Stephen Mues, Karin Dalziel, Deborah Kilgore, and Cameron Sinclair form the technical
               staff. DAP is a completed digital project, that is to say, it is an edition where the
               funding period has come to a close. However, it could still have more to offer, which
               I will point out in this review. Unfortunately, there is no saying whether future
               funding may occur.</p>
<p>Apart from that, its status as a completed project makes it possible to
               draw a proper conclusion on whether DAP achieved its objectives. This review will
               address different aspects of DAP step by step. Specific focus will be placed on the
               contents of the edition and data exploration possibilities.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Design and Usability</h3>
<p>Homepage of Digital Austin Papers.
               I will begin this review with a brief description of the general
               presentation of the website, as this is the first impression one gets when visiting a
               new digital platform. The first thing that catches the eye when opening the website
               is the portrait of Stephen F. Austin<span class="note">[The portrait was painted by William Howard in
                  1833, one year before Austin was arrested on suspicion of inciting rebellion and
                  imprisoned in Mexico City. The portrait strongly resembles Chester Harding’s 1820
                  portrait of Daniel Boone (Taylor
                     2015). Daniel Boone himself was a known early American frontiersman (Britannica 2023).]</span>,
               effectively putting a face to the name (see <a href="#abb1" target="_blank">figure 1</a>). The overall design is clean, with a colour scheme based on the
               aforementioned portrait.</p>
<p>The homepage offers a short introduction, providing context to the
               subject matter and highlighting the aim of the digital edition. A box to the right
               gives an overview of the total number of letters, authors, recipients, and locations
               presented in the edition.<span class="note">[A total of 2183 letter, 668 authors, 341
                  recipients, and 223 locations.]</span> This is a welcome sight, as it gives the
               user a preliminary understanding of the subject matter and scope of the project.
               Although the introduction states that the digital edition focuses on “the turbulent
               world of the Texas borderlands during the 1820s and 1830s” (<a href="#austin2016b" target="_blank">Digital Austin Papers 2016b</a>), there are documents
               dated as early as 1789. The scope of DAP could be described in more detail on the
               homepage. As it is, users will only find this information when exploring the
               materials or reading the ‘About’ page. This observation also applies to the
               correspondents, as DAP holds letters not addressed to or composed by Stephen
               Austin.</p>
<p>Starting from the homepage, the collection is accessible through one of
               two means: The first is through the navigation bar with links to the ‘Search’,
               ‘Browse’, ‘About’, and ‘Contact’ pages respectively. The second is by clicking on the
               number of letters, authors, etc. found in the ‘counter box’. Selecting the total
               count of authors and recipients leads to the ‘Browsing’ page with the respective
               filter selected. In contrast, clicking on the total number of locations leads to the
               search. This may not seem intuitive because no specific location is selected for the
               full-text search. As a user, I expected a different destination: the browsing page
               with ‘origin’ or ‘destination’ selected, as is the case with the senders/recipients.
               For this to be plausible, the statistics would need to be adjusted to ‘origin’ and
               ‘destination’.</p>
<p>Overall, the website is easy to navigate. All relevant information is
               readily available and the navigation is relatively intuitive. This is aided by the
               fact that the website does not have many sub-sites that require users to click to the
               next page. The website itself is monolingual: all the texts and labels are in
               English.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Content of the Edition</h3>
<p><em>Digital Austin Papers</em> primarily focuses on the correspondence of Austin
               from the 1820s and 1830s. This includes a variety of document types such as letters,
               contracts, accounts, and more. The documents included in this digital edition are not
               limited to those penned by or sent to Stephen F. Austin. Several manuscripts belong
               to Austin’s family members and key associates.</p>
<p>At present, the digital edition consists of 2183<span class="note">[The statistics provided on the starting page
                  state 2183 letters; however, a quick count of the unique xml:ids found in the
                  edition’s data repository suggests the number is off by one and that there may be
                  2184 XML texts.]</span> letters. The corpus covers the English-language documents
               collected in <a href="https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fba65" target="_blank">Eugene C. Barker</a>’s printed edition of the Austin Papers, and additional
               English-language documents found in the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History
               (DB-CAH). A key factor in the decision to utilise the letters collected and
               transcribed in Barker’s edition is one universal to all edition projects: the need to
               allocate the project’s limited time and funding efficiently. As clearly stated in the
               project’s ‘About’ page, digitising the letters from the printed edition offered a
               greater return than creating new transcripts from the manuscripts. The main argument
               is the accuracy of Baker’s transcriptions of the original manuscripts.<span class="note">[Some details on the review process and the
                  quality of Barker’s transcripts are provided in the project’s
                  documentation.]</span> I am sure the community can appreciate this decision,
               especially since it also allowed the editors of DAP to allocate time to include
               additional papers that were previously left out of the Barker edition and were only
               partially available in various scattered collections. Scholars now have the
               opportunity to browse everything on one platform.</p>
<p>The decision to focus solely on the English texts in the preliminary
               stage of the project is not explicitly justified. Even though the majority of
               manuscripts are in English, there is also a substantial portion in Spanish and other
               languages (for example, the “<a href="#moses" target="_blank">Moses and Stephen
                  F. Austin Papers</a>” collection in The Portal to Texas History consists of 80%
               English and 19% Spanish texts). Taking a multilingual approach would be a great asset
               to the edition. On a positive note, further material with the same base conditions is
               available and could be used to extent the digital edition.</p>
<p>DAP covers a variety of different materials, spanning from personal
               letters to documents sent to or from political and bureaucratic bodies. A quick query
               for the distinct values found in //textDesc/channel of the XML files
               reveals that there are 174 channels by which their contents are categorised.<span class="note">[Compare TEI entry for
                     <channel>: https://web.archive.org/web/20230312100344/https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-channel.html.]</span>
               The following list provides the first ten channel modes found in the XML files.
                  "Letter"
                  "Remarks"
                  "Contract"
                  "Agreement"
                  "Statement"
                  "Statement"
                  "Memorandum"
                  "Account of Shipment"
                  "Statement of Account"
                  "Militia Commission"</p>
<p>This small snippet of values shows how diverse the content of the corpus
               is regarding the different document types. The breadth of materials alone makes this
               digital edition a useful resource for scholars from different fields, working on
               different research questions. Unfortunately, the channel count given above is not
               quite accurate and exaggerates the variety within DAPs documents. The values given in
               the XML are not always consistent, evident here in the two ‘Statement’ values, only
               deviating by a whitespace. Combinations of document types, such as ‘Letter / Court
               Case’, are also present in the XML files. As useful and interesting as this
               information is to researchers, such combinations complicate the data model and
               machine readability. Pros and cons should be discussed and made transparent. Overall,
               some data cleaning is needed before reliable conclusions can be drawn. Once cleaned,
               the categorisation of the documents would make an interesting browsing option for
               DAP, providing new perspectives on the dataset.</p>
<p>Full-text view of an Austin letter.
               The digital texts are presented individually as full-texts, accessible
               either through the browsing options or through the search. To give a visual example,
                  <a href="#abb2" target="_blank">figure 2</a> provides a screenshot of a
               letter from John Blanchard and George Lauman to Moses Austin sent on the 16th of
               March, 1795 (cf. <a href="#barker2021" target="_blank">Barker 1924</a>). As
               depicted, each full-text viewer provides a title (predominantly Sender to Recipient
               and Date), a summary of the contents extracted from the print edition, followed by
               the text and the source of the letter.<span class="note">[The source refers to the printed edition
                  compiled by Barker rather than a suggested citation for the digital edition.]</span> Further contextual materials such as editorial comments, links to external
               sources etc., are not present. Offset to the top right, a ‘Download XML’ button
               offers users direct access to the letter’s XML file, which is a highly valuable
               feature. Due to various reasons, some digital editions choose only to offer their XML
               files in bulk from a public repository.<span class="note">[Something DAP also does.]</span> Although this
               option is preferable in some scenarios, for example when using the edition’s data for
               other projects, a single file download is a nice addition to gain a quick
               understanding of the data.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the XML files, the text encoding of the data
               seems rather sparse. A key point to begin with: DAP’s XML follows the TEI-P5
               guidelines, version 2.3.0, and was validated against the version 2.3.0 P5 DTD.<span class="note">[See https://web.archive.org/web/20231126160009/https:/tei-c.org/Vault/P5/2.3.0/xml/tei/custom/schema/dtd/.]</span>
               The project’s documentation makes no mention of a project-specific schema. By
               following the TEI format, and clearly documenting this decision, DAP facilitates
               possible future integration of its data into other corpora. Thus, DAP fulfils one of
               the aspects recommended by the FAIR principles.<span class="note">[For more information on the FAIR principles
                  see https://web.archive.org/web/20231211084756/https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/.]</span></p>
<p>Also found in the project’s documentation is a description of the XML
               file creation process. This includes a summary of the steps starting with the initial
               digitization, transcription through OCR, and finally editing/tagging. There is
               mention of various metadata fields to be included in the XML files, as well as some
               data points to be tagged.</p>
<p>Concerning the <body> of the texts, the documentation
               only states that mentioned people and places were tagged. Looking at the XML files it
               is clear that these requirements have been met. Next to some minor stylistic and
               structural tags such as <div1>, <p> and
                  <hi>, the focus has been placed on people, places, and dates.
               Considering DAP’s aim to explore sentiment and topic modelling based browsing
               functionalities, further tagging of the text body is not strictly necessary. Name,
               place, and date tags cover all the remaining search options.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning, however, that the tagged people and places do
               not come with @ref, project-specific IDs or Authority File IDs. This is
               a missed opportunity, especially considering that the standardized place names found
               in the <teiHeader> (<placeName type="origin"> and
                  <placeName type="destination">
               <span class="note">[These elements are found in the
                     <sourceDesc>. Information describing the actions of a
                  correspondence (for example the act of sending or receiving) are commonly found in
                     <correspDesc>. For more details, see https://web.archive.org/web/20231211144836/https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/de/html/ref-correspDesc.html.]</span>)
               were passed through Geonames to collect coordinates for the map-based browsing
               interface. It should not pose too much work to retroactively create project-based
               person IDs or add geoNames IDs in the XML files, should work on the project continue
               in the future. On the other hand, including Authority File IDs for correspondents may
               require more effort and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. The results,
               however, would be worth the effort. These additions could improve some of the search
               results discussed later in this review. The interoperability and reusability of DAP’s
               data would also be positively affected, as it improves the finding and linking of
               people/places across projects.</p>
<p>Overall, the data has much to offer, more than is currently tagged. One
               example would be organisations mentioned in the text. Occasionally, these are tagged
               as places (<placeName>) rather than institutions.<span class="note">[This is the case in John Adams’ letter to
                  Stephen Austin from the 7th of January 1808: https://web.archive.org/web/20220630202923/http://digitalaustinpapers.org/document?id=APB0134.xml.]</span>
               Stephen F. Austin’s role as a land agent meant that he had close connections with
               government institutions and small businesses. Tagging these mentions and
               incorporating them into the search would lead to new research opportunities. Creating
               and presenting a list of all tagged organisations and their frequency could prove
               very interesting.</p>
<p>Having said that, it would be remiss not to mention the inclusion of the
                  <revisionDesc> element and the <change>
               tags. These tags document major changes made to the files, when these occurred, and
               who was responsible for the changes. By incorporating this information in the
                  <teiHeader>, DAP takes measures to ensure documented versioning
               of its data. The data stages pertaining to the first two major changes (“Digital
               creation of XML file” and “Restructured to meet TEI P5 standards”<span class="note">[The changes are consistent across all XML
                  files. Compare with GitHub Repository: https://github.com/DigitalAustinPapers/AustinTranscripts.]</span>) can
               be compared in the project’s GitLab repository, in the folders ‘source_xml’ and
               ‘teip5_xml’.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Documentation</h3>
<p>DAP’s documentation is primarily located on the ‘About’ page of the
               website. The informative text is divided into eleven sections: <a href="https://digitalaustinpapers.org/about#overview" target="_blank">Overview</a>, <a href="https://digitalaustinpapers.org/about#manuscript-print" target="_blank">Austin Papers in
                  Manuscript and Print</a>, <a href="https://digitalaustinpapers.org/about#creating" target="_blank">Creating the Digital

                  Development of DAP</a>, and <a href="https://digitalaustinpapers.org/about#copyright" target="_blank">Copyright</a>. Each
               section gives a concise description of the relevant aspects of the project and
               provides external links to repositories or secondary literature when applicable.
               Overall, the documentation is well executed.</p>
<p>The more technical aspects of the digital edition<span class="note">[Here I refer to sections such as ‘Data
                  Transformation’ or ‘Sentiment Analysis’.]</span> are recorded in a way that can be
               easily understood, making it accessible to all users regardless of their technical
               proficiencies. Personally, as someone more familiar with the coding and technical
               aspects of digital scholarly editions, I find that there are one or two occasions
               where I wish the documentation had gone into greater detail. One example is the
               inclusion of links to the GitHub repository of the open-source ruby sentiment
               analysis libraries used in the testing process.</p>
<p>Historical context for the edition is provided in abbreviated form on
               the homepage and in slightly more detail on the ‘About’ page. Overall, the contextual
               information is only sufficient for users with prior knowledge of the time period and
               the key figures portrayed. To ensure a better understanding and appreciation for
               DAP’s subject matter, the editors may consider adding a new page dedicated to the
               historical context of the project. Similarly, a DAP-specific bibliography with
               project-relevant sources would be a useful addition, if developments on the project
               recommence.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Licensing and Citations</h3>
<p>The DAP is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
               Unported License.<span class="note">[For more details see
                  https://web.archive.org/web/20230311010802/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/.]</span> This information is easily found under ‘Copyright’ on the ‘About’ page.
               Alternatively, a detailed Apache License text is available in the project’s GitHub
               ‘Digital Austin Site’ repository.<span class="note">[See https://github.com/DigitalAustinPapers/DigitalAustinSite.]</span>
               Without reopening the discussion of which licence is most suitable for a digital
               scholarly edition, the chosen licensing permits free access to reuse and adapt the
               project data. In the age of open access and linked open data, this is a welcome sight
               to all researchers. Regarding DAP’s citability, some things are left to be desired.
               Neither the digital edition as a whole nor the individual letters in the corpus offer
               a citation suggestion or permalink. Although a convenient addition to any edition,
               this can be excused if all relevant citation information is found easily on the
                  website.<span class="note">[See Bleier 2021 for more details on how to cite a digital edition.]</span>
               Unfortunately, this is only partially true for DAP. The digital edition does a
               commendable job of recognising its contributors, and listing the names and roles of
               the editorial and technical staff (both on the website and in the XML files).<span class="note">[Compare with the ‘About’ page: https://web.archive.org/web/20231205064022/https://digitalaustinpapers.org/about.]</span> The developing institutions and project partners are also clearly named in
               the website footer. Unfortunately, the date of publication, or alternatively the
               general runtime of the project, appears to be missing. I recommend amending this data
               point as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Despite this minor criticism, the digital edition does a thorough job of
               ensuring users know how and to what extent their materials are reusable. Combined
               with the two XML download options available to users (direct download of single files
               or in bulk from the GitHub repository AustinTranscripts), DAP lays the foundation for
               transparency of the research process and enables access to data for futher
               research.</p>
</section>

<section id="div6">
  <h3 class="h5">Data Exploration</h3>
<p>The area in which DAP particularly excels is offering its users many
               different views on the documents. Subdivided into browsing and search
               functionalities, both approaches are accessible through the navigation bar and the
               counters provided on the home page of the digital edition.</p>
</section>

<section id="div7">
  <h3 class="h5">DAP and the FAIR Principles</h3>
<p>DAP covers various aspects of a digital edition following the FAIR
               principles, but some areas can be improved on.</p>
<p>Finding the edition for first-time visitors may be tricky, as it is not
               registered in well-known catalogues such as the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240218141740/https:/dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/" target="_blank">Catalogue of Digital Editions</a>” and “<a href="https://www.digitale-edition.de/" target="_blank">a catalogue of: Digital Scholarly
                  Editions</a>”. DAP is, however, the first result found in a regular search
               engine. Once on the platform, researchers have full access to the collected and
               processed data. The documents can be explored using the website interface or
               downloaded individually as TEI/XML files. Alternatively, users can access the web
               code and data through the project’s GitHub repository. This is a recommendable aspect
               of DAP as it is open access and offers researchers another place to find the
               project’s research data. To further improve the findability of the data DAP could
               consider publishing its data in subject-relevant repositories, if available. Doing
               this would place the project in context with similar editions and make it visible to
               a wider audience. The materials are easily accessible and available for re-use under
               a CC-BY-SA 3.0 licence. DAP does not provide an API to permit automatic queries of
               the data.</p>
<p>The brief but concise documentation provides information on all of the
               steps involved in the development of DAP, as well as the reasoning behind them. This
               allows users to gain a full understanding of the source material and the processing
               involved. Major changes made to the TEI/XML are recorded in the
                  <teiHeader> of the files, along with the individuals
               involved.</p>
<p>DAP adheres to the norm in terms of the data format. Its documents
               follow the TEI-standard; the precise version and schema used for validation are
               recorded and easy to find. A project-specific schema was not used, which is
               understandable given the comparatively low level of data tagging. Nevertheless, the
               lack thereof can affect the reusability and interoperability of the research
               data.</p>
<p>The same applies to the data modelling, which leaves room for
               improvement. Project-relevant aspects were included in the data model, such as
               mentioned people and places, and the creation/destination locations of the documents.
               Unfortunately, these data points were not assigned project-specific IDs or Authority
               File IDs. Including these would improve certain aspects of the data, such as better
               facilitating its integration into- or cross-referencing with external sources.</p>

  <h3 class="h5">Conclusion</h3>
<p><em>Digital Austin Papers</em> offers researchers a platform to search through
               and access Stephen F. Austin’s vast collection of correspondence from the 1820s and
               1830s. The edition aims to test and provide new ways to explore its material,
               revealing new patterns hidden within. The project’s ‘Browsing’ page offers users the
               standard array of filter options: correspondents, location, and date. The ‘Search’,
               on the other hand, is where DAP sets itself apart. It demonstrates how different
               approaches and methods can be integrated into a digital edition to reveal new
               perspectives on the data. An example of this is the inclusion of sentiment analysis.
               This method is interesting given the historical climate in which the correspondences
               were written. When combined with time as a factor, this functionality can reflect
               emotional changes during a time when society and politics were in flux.</p>
<p>The subject material is accessible on the DAP website and in the
               project’s GitHub repository, where the TEI/XML files are available for reuse under a
               CC-BY-SA 3.0 licence. The project’s documentation explicitly encourages this.
               Overall, DAP briefly addresses all the different aspects of the edition, explaining
               certain decisions made in the development process. For example, DAP clarifies why
               they chose to unitise the Barker edition for its transcriptions.</p>
<p>The materials handled in DAP are valuable resources for scholars
               interested in the Texas area during the early 19th century. The documents hold
               first-hand accounts and reactions to the historical events leading to the Texas
               Revolution. For this reason, DAP has the potential to provide its researchers with
               more in-depth access to the materials than currently provided. The data modelling is
               relatively simple, covering core aspects such as mentioned people and places.
               Addressing other aspects of the text, for example, mentioned organisations and
               discussed topics would offer additional entry points into the corpus. Providing more
               historical context would also give researchers a better framework by which they can
               explore DAP’s historically rich materials.</p>
<p>Overall, I find that <em>Digital Austin Papers</em> succeeded in its
               aims and brought forth a valuable and interesting digital scholarly edition. It also
               has the potential to improve its offer, in terms of both the volume and quality of
               data.</p>
