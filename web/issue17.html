          <h3><a href="issue17/austin-papers.html">Digital Austin Papers</a></h3>
          <div><p>The digital edition Digital Austin Papers (DAP) collects the
               correspondence of Stephen F. Austin and a selection of key associates from the 1820s
               and 1830s. It provides valuable insight into the changes occurring in the Texas
               borderlands during the early 19th century, both politically and socially. DAP offers
               full-text views of the collection of letters and two methods to download their
               TEI/XML files. Great emphasis is placed on browsing and search functionalities,
               striving to test new ways to discover patterns within the dataset. Its incorporation
               of sentiment analysis is one of DAP’s more unique characteristics. DAP has great
               potential but requires some additional data processing (e.g. assigning authority file
               IDs) to achieve it.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue17/duerrenmatt.html">Friedrich Dürrenmatts Stoffe-Projekt als digitale Edition</a></h3>
          <div><p>The Stoffe-project is a text-genetic hybrid edition that digitally processes and
               presents the works of the Swiss writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–1990). The estate
               is part of the founding inventory of the Swiss Literary Archives (SLA), where it has
               been indexed since 1991, one year after Dürrenmatt’s death, and initially digitally
               processed in a preliminary version. This served as the scientific basis for the
               five-volume print edition that was published in May 2021. Editors are Rudolf Probst
               and Ulrich Weber. The sophisticated new edition is linked to a digital edition in
               which Dürrenmatt’s autobiographical works can be explored. In the three sections
               “Text”, “Genesis”, and “Archive”, the online edition offers, on the one hand, the
               text of the selection edition in digital form, and, on the other hand, text-genetic
               tools for orientation, as well as the entire manuscript material in the scope of
               about 30,000 leaves in the form of facsimiles. Thus, Dürrenmatt’s most important work
               complex of the late oeuvre can be experienced as a process in all its dynamics and
               complexity. Although Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s complex of materials is made accessible
               in digital form, it does not meet common best practices of digital scholarly editions
               which in turn has a negative impact on its compliance with the FAIR principles.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue17/europaeische-religionsfrieden.html">Europäische Religionsfrieden Digital</a></h3>
          <div><p>The project European Religious Peace Agreements - A Digital Edition
                  (EuReD) is a long-term project in the Academies’ Program of the Union of
               German Academies, which focuses on the period after the European religious wars and
               is based on various already existing editions. It aims to lay the foundation for
               further research in religious studies, cultural studies, linguistics, and history. By
               reprocessing and re-using data and tools from previous projects, the long-term
               project represents a remarkable FAIR Data use case. Through solid editorial
               craftsmanship and the avoidance of visual or technical novelties, the project itself
               is geared toward long-term usability. By making the worked-upon documents accessible
               from the early funding phase, the project embraces openness and provides insight into
               the editorial process. Expectedly, there are gaps and ambiguities, which – at this
               early stage – are unavoidable and are mentioned by the reviewers in favor of the
               project's further development rather than to point out definite weaknesses.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue17/okopenko.html">Die Tagebücher von Andreas Okopenko (1949–1954)</a></h3>
          <div><p>The publication of Andreas Okopenko’s diaries from 1949 to 1954 is a digital edition
               that includes carefully transcribed diary entries with thoughtful and transparent,
               although not always easily accessible, editing guidelines. The presentation of the
               digital edition offers engagement with the contents in different ways, whether
               reading the diaries in chronological order or exploring them through linked data and
               indexes, but a full-text search is missing. The research data collected is enriched
               with metadata and available for subsequent use in a repository in the form of TEI-XML
               files and with an open license. Although API exists, the generated research data is
               not yet fully integrated in the overarching infrastructure for digital editions at
               the Austrian National Library (ÖNB). The project took a hybrid approach and published
               a printed edition subsequently, which, curiously, covers a longer period than the
               digital edition. The website, however, lacks information on whether there will be
               published more diaries in the future.</p>

          <h3><a href="issue17/semper-edition.html">Gottfried Semper: Der Stil – Eine Edition im Aufbau</a></h3>
          <div><p>This review describes the Semper-Edition in its current version of
               March 2024, when work on the edition is at its midpoint of a projected 12-year
               processing time. Nevertheless, it seems suitable to review this resource at this
               point as it gives valuable insight into what constitutes good usability when going
               online at an early production stage. The edition encompasses Gottfried Sempers
               (1803–1879) opus magnum Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten,
                  oder Praktische Aesthetik (1860/1863), including draft versions, fair
               copies, proof stages, and complementing these texts with additional manuscripts
               closely linked to Der Stil, namely Vergleichende Baulehre,
                  Kunstformenlehre and student notes on Semper’s lectures. The edition
               does not create one ‘Leittext’ (scholarly curated text) but aims at making the
               comprehensive content within these texts accessible and usable for different courses
               of analysis, achieving this by using a labelled property graph data base.</p>
